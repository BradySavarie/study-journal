Starting up today with working on the registration page. I just want to send data to the api and save it in the database for the time being. Nothing too time consuming, i've got to be up early for that interview. Probably do the encryption as well while i'm at it.

Cool, accomplished everything above with relative ease. I've got a user in the database now and everything is all configured and running smoothly. Next up is creating the login functionality. I'll be using jwt for authentication.
