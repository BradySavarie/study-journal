This morning I messed around with using the ThemeProvider in materialUI to change the default font. It is an interesting interface, I would really like to figure out MaterialUI workflows because right now I feel pretty lost. Maybe there is a series online I can watch to help me get a better grasp of it, but hey i've got the app working so it's all good! I am scaling back the styling aspirations in order to move to the next project, but i'll use this one as a playground to mess with mui. I order to complete this app I just want a title in the header and perhaps a dark mode toggle. I would really like to figure out how to remove the conditional rendering of the game over screen and just restart a game by default when a user loses. The card flipping animations would be great but i'm going to pass for now as it is not something that is super important.
