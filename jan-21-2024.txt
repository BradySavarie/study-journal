Got about 15 lessons left until the course is complete. Pretty cool I might be able to do that today. I have a friend on the way to meet me for a coffee though so this cafe session wont be too productive. That's alright though, im not in a huge rush anyways. Feeling kind of enxious about this upcoming interview though. I should probably prepare some samples of my work to share at least haha.
