Got in pretty late last night, no real progress was made unfortunately. Going to spend a bit of time now trying to learn more about MaterialUI so I can use it with more confidence. Right now I feel kind of iffy about how i'm using the Box component in particular, and any other layout base components really. That is where i'll st my focus since I only have a short timeframe to work with.
