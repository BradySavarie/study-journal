Today i'm going to be studying the pencil, brush, and stroke tools in illustrator. It should be a good section to go through for the most part as I expect to learn alot about paths which can come in handy alot at work when working with cutlines. Throughout today I had also finished the first half of that book that i'm reading on design and will be learning about type next. Pretty good progress so far.
