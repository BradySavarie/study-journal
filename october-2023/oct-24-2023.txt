Last night ended up being pretty fun. I decided to try my hand at coding one of the interview questions myself and did an alright job at it. The question was reasonably easy though, I just had to figure out how to capitalize every second character of a string. The solution that I ended up with was just about the same as the one the person being interviewed came up with. Gave me a bit of confidence even though I know that i'm bound to asked much more difficult questions. There was a difficult question afterwards and I broke it down in my head, I think i'd be able to work it out. It asked to take a string of html that had a bunch of divs in it and return a new string with every second div tag closed because whoever wrote the html didn't know the tags had to be closed. Interesting problem.

First of all i'd have to figure out how to parse through the string and identify when I hit a div tag. To do that, I could loop through each character (storing each in a new string as I go) and stopping when I hit an open angle bracket. Then I can check if the following 4 characters are 'div>'. If so I have a div tag, if not than keep storing the characters into the new string. Next I will need to be able to identify if it is the opening and closing div tag. TO do so I can initialize a tagCount variable to 1, signifying the open tag. When I identify a div tag I can check if the value is equal to 1. If it is than I have an opening div tag, if it's not I can change the value to 2 so that when I reach the next div tag the code will idenitfy it as the closing tag. If it is an opening div tag to keep pushing characters to the new string, if not than add a forward slash after pushing the angle bracket and switch the tagCount back to 1. Continue this process until all characters are looked at and return the resulting string. 

I think the above will work but I am really wanting to test it so I am gonna do that quickly!

Yep, it worked! That was a fun exercise.
