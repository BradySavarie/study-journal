Planning on completing all of the effect controller functions this afternoon. Had a bit of a hang up trying to debug the create post controller function last night but it's all sorted out now. I've been creating the views along the way of course to. Makes it easier to create them together as they rely on eachother and can be tested simultaneously.

Starting up tomorrow with the effect delete post controller function. Once that is done I will have the update functions remaining, however I would like to move to the effect instance controllers first and catch up there so that I can test out the crud operations. I cannot test the delete yet without going into mongodb atlas and removing an effect instance manually. The effect delete is dependant on whether or not insances of the effect exist already.
