Okay, I think I need to go through a nice long full-stack node tutorial. I am having a very hard time being bothered trying to write out pug templates for this members-only project for some reason. I think it's because I know that the end result will be a project that I have no interest in actually doing anything with. I am aware that it will be good practice to go through it just to have the experience under my belt but man I really feel like my time can be better spent iterating on a full-stack project to really brew up some excitement again. Maybe I can make a find a nicely designed blog site tutorial the uses the full MERN stack, including authentication and everything else ive learned. I think that would be really nice. I hate hate the idea of skipping a project on TOP though, i've come such a long way without skipping a single thing. Perhaps i've gotten to the point now though where it is a necessry thing in order to make serious progress.
