Today was a bit of a rough day at work so I decided to revamp the old resume instead of working on programming stuff. I think it was time well spent regardless. It is shocking to see how much the content on my resume has actually improved over time! I hope I get some people that are interested in talking to me some more. I have sign making, management, entrepreneurship, administration stuff, and web development all on there. Feeling good, I think it's time to start applying and seeing what kind of responses I can get from the market.
