Some progress has been made since last night. I created an api and learned how to connect to it from the front-end using axios. Right now it is just using the localhost server of course so im not sure how that is going to work on deploy but im looking forward to finding out. I think the next step in the process is going to be saving the information that I send via a post request to a mongo database and then connecting that database to the api. This will set me up to be able to do the authentication logic. From what I can tell so far I won't be using passport for authentication on this app which is a little bit of an unwelcome change as I am just getting used to the auth framework and would like more practice using the local strategy, however learning more is always a good thing too so no big deal. If I really don't like the methods that are used for authentication I could always just choose to scrap that and do it myself using passport.

So far so good! I've created a database, implemented the User model, allowed a user to be registered to the database, and displayed error messages if it didn't work. The password is encrypted via bcrypt as learned previously and i've used dotenv to help secure the mongo connection string. Next up is making the login page functional since I have a user to actually login.
