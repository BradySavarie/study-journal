Yesterday I had finished up the lesson that walked through connecting a database to my application using Mongoose. Feeling pretty good about it. This meant that I completed the MVC & CRUD lesson as well on TOP. I decided to start watching a MongoDB tutorial video that demonstrated some database concepts using the nodejs driver because it was an additional resource listed in the course. Lost the fight to fatigue halfway through that video though so I think i'm going to finish it up and then move on to the next lesson in the OdinProject which I believe is going to be a mini messaging app project.

Alright I made it through that Mongoose tutorial video and it covered some interesting topics. Definitely not a tough technology to learn, I should be able to work with it without too many issues coming up. I have some syntax to learn but model, schemas, and queries are straightforward enough topics that I don't feel the need to dive into all of the fine details right now. I'm sure as problems arise I will be able to just look up the docs.

I'm on the message board project now. It is super small and basically 100% guided. Should be able to finish it up in an hour of work or so, and then i'll be moving on to learning about deployment.
