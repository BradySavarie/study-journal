Yesterday I had finished up the lesson that walked through connecting a database to my application using Mongoose. Feeling pretty good about it. This meant that I completed the MVC & CRUD lesson as well on TOP. I decided to start watching a MongoDB tutorial video that demonstrated some database concepts using the nodejs driver because it was an additional resource listed in the course. Lost the fight to fatigue halfway through that video though so I think i'm going to finish it up and then move on to the next lesson in the OdinProject which I believe is going to be a mini messaging app project.
