Tonight has been successful for coding. I didn't spend much time yet but have had pretty strong focus. Over the past hour i've added the ability to save messages and display them within the messageboard component. I didn't have to use many resources to figure it out so I feel as if the knowledge has really solidifed since building that airbnb project. I definitely learned alot doing that so I intend on doing some more full-stack tutorials in the future to try and get an idea of how the pros work. It gave me confidence in the decisions that I am making. 

Where I really struggle is with design and css. It's not that I don't have the technical knowledge to make things, but it takes me so long to design something that I like and I have to make so many minor tweaks to the css. I definitely could improve at that, it would really impact my ability to write applications quickly. This kind of thing is best figured out over repetition but to be honest I find it tough to get into the groove when I know I have to design something. I wonder if I can find a way to improve my skills enough where I am comfortable sitting down and cranking out a design without too much effort going in to it.
