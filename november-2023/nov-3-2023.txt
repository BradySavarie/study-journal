THe goal tonight is just to solve the problem that I ran into yesterday regarding the user object being null when the account page is refreshed. I had a really hard time figuring it out yesterday so I am expecting to get into a challenge today. 

Woo fixed a challenging problem all on my end! I did some really solid debugging for that one. Stepped through each step of the process, checking the key values being passed between server and client with each get request. Eventually I found that after the token is verified I was finding a user in the database that matched the users id stored in the token and then detructuring out a couple values to be sent back to the client. The problem was that I was sending only a portion of the values back accidentally because I didn't bundle them as a proper json object. Once I fixed that up everything went back to normal and the data is persisting through each refresh. Feels good to find an error like that, builds confidence.
