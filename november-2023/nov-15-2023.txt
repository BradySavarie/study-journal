Interview went good today. Might get the chance to actual use some development skills! She mentioned wordpress development and that they are working on an application of their own which is interesting. Probably something to do with booking shoots and downloading photographs. Crazy to think that this could set me down the path to be a photographer and/or developer. See what happens I guess.

So last night I had finished building up the registration page. The next step is going to be to send the user information from the client to the api, create a model for the user, and then create a database to store that user in. I'll need to make sure I encrypt the password to keep it safe. The next step after that will be the login functionality which will involve setting up jwt's for verification. Well either I do that or I use the passport local strategy that i learned in a previous project. I'm leaning towards jwt though to try and solidify my ability to use it properly.
