Last day of December already! This vacation has been pretty productive in terms of learning design. Last night I completed the layer styles section of the photoshop course and this morning I got through the cropping section. Learned some pretty basic stuff such as adding drop shadows and cropping/expanding images (using content-aware fill/generative expand). Nothing groundbreaking here quite yet but my comfort level with the software is increasing for sure.
