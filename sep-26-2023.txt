I've got a lot of work cut out for me in this next lesson! The focus is all on working with forms. SHould be interesting as retreiving data from users via form submissions will allow me to perform the remaining crud operations and finish up programming this library tutorial application. I'm curious to see how to approach grabbing data from forms on the server side actually because it is something that I will be doing a lot of i'm sure. This tutorial has been awesome so far, really nice to put together a back-end application after working in the front-end for quite awhile. Can't wait to learn how to merge all of the front-end technology together with the back-end to create a real full-stack app. Getting so close now to having a solid foundation in programming. At least solid enough to start building some decent apps.
