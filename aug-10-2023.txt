Alright so yesterday I created a pretty nice nav and hero section for my personal website. While doing this I realized how useful having Figma as a skillset could potentially be as far as developing websites goes. When I get hired at some point down the line I probably won't have to worry too much about designing beautiful interfaces as that will be up toa designer, but I can definitely benefit from knowing how to do it if the need arises. Especially with personal projects and freelance work. I know that design is important to me personally even though I don't want to make it a front-and-center part of my career. So yea since I want to make the best portfolio that I can manage right now before moving on to back-end I am going to start by taking a comprehensive course in Figma that I found online. This will introduce me to the ins and outs of how the software works and hopefully give me some best practices. Once I have that taken care of I will continue applying what i've learned to my portfolio site. This is of course a bit of a detour but I feel good about it. This is technically my final project in the advanced html and css section so sinking some time into this is still related as it will help me write my styles more efficiently and with vision. Could be indispensable because there is a lot of mental friction involved with designing a site while building it for me. I've noticed that I am hesistant to try coding something up when I am not sure how it will look, so this can give me some assurance before hand that I am putting effort into the right things. Also, after I spend time stying a feature I tend to stick with the original idea because alot of effort was involved in getting it right. Perhaps this will help me come up with betters ideas to build off rather than settling on what I thought of first.
