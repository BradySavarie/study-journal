Tonight i'd like to get my finished portfolio site deployed! I think i'm just going to go ahead and use netlify to keep things simple. When I start using nextJs I will move on to Vercel for deployment. This shouldn't take too long (that statement always comes back to bite me but i'll make it anyways). Once it is live I plan on moving forward with the nodeJs course I started yesterday. I believe I should be learning more about requests and response to start things off which im assuming will go a little bit deeper into the http module. Now that i'm getting my footing a bit i'm starting to get more excited about studying back-end topics.
