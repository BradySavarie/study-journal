Crappy day again. Got the news that I have to spend $2,250 to fix my car up... 1 step forward, 2 steps back man. At least I can try and be thankful that I have had the opportunity to save enough money to cover the many emergencies that have come up this year. I can't imagine what I would have done in different circumstances.

Anyways, I ended up doing a portion of the REST api article last night that i'm reading through for the odin project. It's a long one but pretty interesting! Continuing on with it this afternoon.
