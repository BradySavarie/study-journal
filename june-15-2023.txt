Todays mission is to learn about styled-components in React! I'm kind of excited. Adding a new tool to the belt is always a fun thing to do. I don't expect to make any real progress on the cv-builder today as I focus on learning this new styling technique, but perhaps i'll get lucky and see how I can apply it immediately to my project. I have a feeling this will lead into learning about styled component libraries such as Material UI or Emotion (at least I think that's what those are), so I can consider this as an introduction to learning about those things as well. 

Here is a list of css skills/approaches that I would like to be comfortable with:

    - Vanilla CSS
    - Sass/Scss
    - CSS Modules
    - Tailwind
    - Bootstrap
    - Material UI
    - Styled-Components

I'd say i've learned quite a bit today! I have implemented a styled-components system now and I like the modular approach as it takes away any issues with the cascade. It is a little tricky to keep track of all the stylesheets in a project but hey pros and cons. I also found a suitable resume template that i'm going to try and follow for this project. It is very straightforward from a design perspective which is nice. I also played around a bit with the idea of using Material UI but i don't know if I should even bother right now since i'm in the middle of learning something new already.
