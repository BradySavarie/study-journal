Today i'm going to be learning about the join tool, the intertwine tool (i think it is a tool as opposed to a technique), and how to expand appearances. These 3 functionalities should come in pretty handy, i'll write about them once i've actually learned how they all work.

I feel like my learning pace has been pretty slow compared to my expectations. This course is taking awhile! I'm okay with it though as I am not in a race. My main concern is that the knowledge sinks in - I want to be able to know which tools to reach for when I am solving design problems rather than trying to hammer it out with the things that I know. An in depth understanding of this software is important.

I read a little bit more of that book today too by the way. I am learning right now how to properly contrast text which will help me make better decisions when pairing different fonts with eachother. This was one of the learning goals that I set out to improve at because pairing fonts is something that I can use all the time at work.

The join tool is pretty sweet. When lines closely overlap eachother but are not joined you can basically scribble overtop to indicate that areas to join and the tool will know eactly how to join them together for you. It is not useful in all cases as the points that you are joining need to be close together. The is also the path join and path average functions that you can use. Path join connects to points using a straight line. Path average takes the two points, finds the 'average' location between the and creates overlapping anchor points at that location. This is a smoother look than just a straight line but you have to remember that the paths dont actually get joined. You still need to run the join function on the two overlapping anchor points. There is also the shapebuilder tool that is a great way to join paths. When you fill in an area it joins up the paths that surround it for you.
