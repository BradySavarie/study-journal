Today I did alot of equipment troubleshooting/maintenance at work. The UV printer has alot of problems with the laser levelling system that is designed to identify when an item is too close to the print head. It should prevent head collisions and protect both the item and the print heads. It works by using laser to send a beam across the printable area into a sensor on the other side. The beam should be completely flat and positioned directly below where the print head sits. Our machine is sitting on casters right now though which causes the machine to shake everytime it is in operation, and this shaking slowly causes the bracket th at holds the laser in place to shift out of place. When it shifts downwards we get false errors that are triggered telling us that the item is too close to the printhead when it really is not, and when it shifts upwards we risk head collisions since nothing is being triggered to tell us when a piece is a bit too high. Unfortunately the bracket is very hard to adjust properly as it requires complete precision yet we cannot seem to adjust it in a way that allows it to sit right where we need it. It is probably our error to be honest because we are not trained on how to properly level it out, however it seems that the bracket is poorly designed from our point of view because it should be a simple adjustment to get the laser into place. When the laser is hitting the sensor a number is displayed on it that tells us how close to the target point the laser is currently at and we cannot get it to align properly. I managed to get the machine running in the meantime without triggering errors but it is frustrating to not have a way to solve the issue. I really want a tech to come down and perform the levelling while also training us on the process but that is a pricey thing to do since we are considered to be in a remote location.
