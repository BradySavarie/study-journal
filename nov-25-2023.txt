I am excited for this opportunity and very grateful that you have decided to extend an offer my way. Reeledge seems like a great business to be a part of and I have alot of respect for you for building it from the ground up. As interesting as the job is to me though I have to admit that I am struggling to make a decision. The reduced compensation compared to what I am earning now is a tough pill to swallow and it is important to me that I ensure I am making a financially responsible long-term decision.

My intentions are to use the skills that I learn from you and your team to benefit your business specifically. I recognize how expensive training is and I don't want to allow you to invest your time and money into me until I can be sure that the value that I will end up generating for your business is enough to result in earning an income that I am comfortable sticking around for. The wage that I am looking towards is $24.57/hour (the equivalent wage to what i'm currently earning working a 40 hour work week, without considering the benefits that I will be giving up). I understand this is quite the jump from the $20/hr being offered - please consider the following plan and let me know your thoughts:

    - We can put in place a training wage of $20/hr for a 3 month training period while I work on becoming a fully functional member of your team. This can help mitigate your concern of training costs.

    - When the training period is over the wage would increase and we can add some additional responsibilities at your discretion that go beyond the job description. Perhaps we can find a way to make use of the web development skills i've been working on here if you see a need, but i'm open to helping in whatever way I can.

    - During this 3 months and beyond I can dedicate some time during the evenings and weekends to start learning Wordpress and the tech stack for your application rather than continue with the technology i'm currently learning. This way when the need arises in the future to have somebody internal work on your applications I can be prepared to contribute. I anticipate this would be a long process but I imagine it would pay off down the line.

I'd also be happy to work for a wage of $23/hr and exchange the 1 hour unpaid lunch for a half hour paid lunch. This should cost you the same as the above plan but you would get an extra 2.5 hours of productivity out of me per week. 

If none of these suggestions work for you please let me know what else you have in mind. I am flexible and want to make sure we are both happy with whatever deal we decide on. Thank you again, the offer is greatly appreciated and I hope that we can work something out.
