Okay what to do today!?

Now that I am able to dynamically generate and delete sections I can go ahead and create a method to generate a sample resume and then clear it out again. The tricky part about this is that I will need access to every input field that currently exists in the DOM so that I can set the value to an empty string. With the code being split up into modules im not sure exactly how I can grab everything that exists on the DOM at the moment. I'll have to research that before moving forward. I think clearing the fields out is where i'll start off, and then once I have that part down I will go ahead and generate the sample data for preview. Next up after that will be styling, and the once that is done all I will have left is creating a PDF (looked into how to do that, doensn't look all that difficult to figure out).
