Had a good time yesterday recreating 11 of the 16 logos on the cover of the logo modernism book. It's been really good practice in terms of using the software and just for solving design problems. I think i'm going to try and get the other 5 done to cap off the mini project. I've also finished both the effects and patterns section of the illustrator course which was pretty interesting. I like the pattern function. It is neat the it creates a custom pattern swatch to use as a fill. Much nicer than use copy paste. The next section is 3D design which i'm not too interested in at the moment but at least Ill learn about a few techniques for it, and then I can go through the final section on exporting to finish the course up. Woo! Made progress with this software for sure.
