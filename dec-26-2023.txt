Had a good time yesterday recreating 11 of the 16 logos on the cover of the logo modernism book. It's been really good practice in terms of using the software and just for solving design problems. I think i'm going to try and get the other 5 done to cap off the mini project. I've also finished both the effects and patterns section of the illustrator course which was pretty interesting. I like the pattern function. It is neat the it creates a custom pattern swatch to use as a fill. Much nicer than use copy paste. The next section is 3D design which i'm not too interested in at the moment but at least Ill learn about a few techniques for it, and then I can go through the final section on exporting to finish the course up. Woo! Made progress with this software for sure.

Zipped through the 3D section pretty quickly this afternoon. The last lessons was by far the most useful. I learned how to generate very realistic mockups using illustrators new mockup function. It is really solid. You just need a photograph of the item and a vector graphic that you want to create a mockup of. Place the graphic over the area of the photograph and click make. Illustrator will analyze the planes in the image and create a mesh that the vector gets adjusted to. The graphic is now conformed to the surface which is awesome. To take it a step further you can also apply a blend mode (multiply is great) so that the texture and lighting in the chosen image comes through in the graphic. The result is a very high quality mockup.
