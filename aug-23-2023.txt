Yesterday I had pretty much perfected the navbar and drawer for the portfolio website, as well as made dark mode a lot more pleasant on the eyes. Today I am going to focus on building up the desktop version of the home section of the site. It will be broken down into a series of Stacks that shouldn't be overly challenging the layout correctly. Then I will need to decide on how to approach adding the photo in. I can export it with the layers underneath as a png but then it would be less customizable. Since I am relying on transparency somewhat I am thinking that I may benefit from breaking it up into layers and then aligning them with css instead. Haven't yet decided what the best route to take is. I could also export a dark version and light version that blends into the background color of the themes, but that would mean if I ever adjust the theme colors I will also have to adjust the photo which is kind of a pain.
