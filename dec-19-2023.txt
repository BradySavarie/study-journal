Tonight i'm going to be moving forward with the illustrator course as per the usual schedule recently. I'm getting to the end of the typography section now. Currently learning how to break apart and outline text which is something that will come in handy all of the time at work.

I also came across this interesting website today called CARI (consumer aesthtics research institute). It is a database of designs that are organized into categories in an attempt to develop a new way to catalog design history. It may be helpful when trying to learn about a certain design aesthetic.
