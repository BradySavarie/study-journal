Okay time to get started. So I was thinking today that a common pain point that has been coming up alot in my projects is the development of my site taking longer due to lack of design planning. Iterating through different design ideas is difficult without using graphic software, so I bet that I will get a better result if I first do the design and then implement it in code. I know that i'm not aiming to be a designer however this skillset may end up coming in handy and a personal portfolio is the ideal time to learn it. I'm going to spend some time learning how to properly use Figma. Since I work in design software all day I feel like i'll catch on pretty quick to this. Being able to list another technology on the resume can't hurt either right? So today i'm going to be going through a figma tutorial to get up and running, and i'd like to recreate a design reference file in the software for both a mobile and desktop view. Not an exact replication but an iteration on it that I can use for my portfolio. I bet doing this will really help get the look right and speed up the actual development process once I get to it.
