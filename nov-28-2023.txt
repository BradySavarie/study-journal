Taking it easy this afternoon, I think i'm just going to put together a plan for what the next steps are to finish the message board app. Aside from the styling there really isn't much left to do.

Just about all of the remaining functionality relies on whether or not the user is a member (with exception to showing a blurred out message board component if the user is not signed in). The first thing that I can do is take care of the actually. I might be able to find a way to overlay a blur filter of some sort on the existing component if the user is not logged in. That is step 1.

Step 2 will be to then add the isMember property to each user and set the default to no whenever a user object is created.

Step 3 is to add a 'become member' button in the the nav when the user is logged in that brings the user to the become member page. The page has a single input that asks the user to solve the following riddle to become a member: 'what is a computers favourite snack?'. The answer will be microchips. If that word is submitted then the users status changes to member, otherwise a message tells the user they are incorrect.

Step 4 is to have the messageboard component conditionally rendered the messages author name and time if the user is a member.

The project can at this point be deployed. I should watch the video for the airbnb clone that covers deployment to help me get this right!
