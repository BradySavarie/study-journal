Yesterday turned into the first zero day in awhile. Major bummer. I ended up being called to an unexpected band practice after work, got back home around 11:15, and then my brain just wouldn't allow me to focus on coding. Had a really hard day at work and there is a lot of conflict that I will have to address on Monday so I couldn't get it out of my head. Today though I think i'm feeling a bit better so i'm getting to work on the Airbnb project. The last thing I have been doing is working on the single place page.
