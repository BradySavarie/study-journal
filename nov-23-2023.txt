The next step for this project is to develop the messageBoard component. This board will display all of the messages that are saved in the database. In order to do this I will of course need a message model. The message model will contain the properties user, time, and body. The component itself will need to be able to identify whether or not the user of each message is a members, and if so the users name and the time of the message will be displayed. If not a member than the plaecholder "Anonymous" will be in place of the name and the time of the message will not be displayed.
