Just finished fixing up the scroll behaviour of the portfolio. I wrote a function that is called with the sections id as a prop when clicked in the navbar. I then select the element with a matching id and call the scrollIntoView method on it with a scroll behaviour of smooth. Pretty slick. The title had to be treated a little bit different as I specifically wanted it to scroll to the top of the screen on click instead. I just put an anonymous function inside of it's on click that called te scrollTo method on the window object with input parameters top: 0, left: 0, and behaviour: smooth. That did the job. I don't think I mentioned in yesterdays journal entry either that I have hooked up framer motion and put some super basic animations on a few home page elements. I'd like to dig into that library somemore to learn how to make some really nice animations since what i've done so far is really straightforward. I learned as well that I can use the library pretty easily with materialUI which is something I was concerned about since framer motion requires that you access their motion component to use it and I wasn't sure how to access that within a custom mui component already. Turns out there is a component prop for that. You can set the component prop to the motion component that you want to use and it will set that as the base that the mui component is built off of. Perfect.
