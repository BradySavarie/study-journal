Time to move forward with the airbnb clone. I am at the half way point in the video right now and the next thing I will be doing is fixing up some bugs and refactoring the existing code. I should probably review the codebase in full again to really make sure I have a grasp on what is going on. Lot's got done recently so it couldn't hurt to try and find any holes in my knowledge that I can.
