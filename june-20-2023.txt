Today I spent some time at work reading about Reacts lifecycle methods. I'm pretty sure I understand how they work and why they exist now. Each instance of a component goes through different stages while it exists. It gets constructed and then mounted to the DOM, rendered, updated, and eventually removed from the DOM. These stages together are referred to as the lifecycle of a component. Reacts class components have built-in methods that are designed to be used at different stages of the lifecycle. For example, componentDidMount is a method that is called as soon as the component has been mounted and is ready.
