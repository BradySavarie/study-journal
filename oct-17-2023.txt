Finished up the passportJS tutorial today! There is so much to authenticatiation, I would hav enever guesssed how much actually goes into implementing it properly within an application. I am little bit intimidated being that I know I need to figure it all out in the next app I make but I seem to understand all the stuff that i've gone over. It's just about remembering it all and ironing out the details! I get to move on now in the odin project though to the next lesson about security configuration. The main takeaway should be how to make darn sure that sensitive information is in fact protected for security purposes.

Got through the lesson above with exception to looking into the nconf library. Going to do that tomorrow. I understand dotenv and have implemented it.
