Okay so I finished up that light mode design for desktop late last night! Pretty stoked on how it came out - I used the template but made some significant enough changes to it to make the final result my own. One thing that I didn't play around with much though is fonts which is something I should definitely spend a bit of time on. Maybe i'll actually start off otday with a little bit of exploration there and see what I can find. I would like to code up the navbar before heading to bed though so that will be the main focus. Not hard, i've done it before a few times of course so I don't expect that take too much time.
