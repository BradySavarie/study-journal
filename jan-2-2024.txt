Tonight i'm going to be learning about filters and smart objects in Photoshop. This is where I get to figure out how to create basic halftone images which is nice as that is a technique i've been excited about. Once i've made it through these sections I would like to spend some time watching Dorion Studio's videos for a bit. I really love his channel, it is so helpful in learning high-quality techniques related to the areas of design that I am interested in personally. Maybe not all that handy in a professional context.. but I get to learn things like treating images with a vintage style and creating weird things like chrome objects and other graphical elements that fit the style of design that I find myself gravitating towards recently.

Alrighty everything above is complete besides the Youtube videos! I learned how to use a bunch of different filters such as oil painting, halftones, lens flares, etc. I also learned that smart objects are just protective wrappers around an element that prevents it from getting messed with by all of the filters and effects. It ensures everything is reversable at the expense of a bigger file size. Worth it in most cases.
