Decision made: I will not be continuing with studying until I have a good grasp on what i'm studying for. I need to allow myself the space to relax so that I can recover from this little phase of burnout. My main focus will be trying to decide on what paths I have available to me and what skills they will require. From there i'll be able to figure out how to acquire those skills most effectively. Right now, learning the 3 adobe suite programs has been great for my current career in graphics production so it has definitely been beneficial. Web development and graphics will also translate well into marketing if I do happent o go that route.
