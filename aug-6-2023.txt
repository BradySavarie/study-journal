Tonight i'm going to be studying responsive images and media queries. Once these lessons are done i'll be all clear to start making my portfolio website. I think i'm going to be bounching back and forth between the portfolio site and the back-end lessons. I won't be able to make much use of the site anyways until I have some good full-stack projects on there worthy of applying for jobs with.
