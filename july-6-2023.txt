Last night I had figured out how basic routing works. I created a practice react app and installed react-router-dom. It seems like a simple concept so far but i'm sure there is a lot of added complexity to it. I just made a few test components and used the router to toggle between them as i updated the pages url. To do this I created a route switch component that is the first component called in my app (so it's located in the index instead of app.js). From there I used a browserRouter to create a few seperate routes that have different paths, and inserted the custom components as the elements that relate to each path. Easy process overall and I can see how beneficial it would be. 

I also learned about the Link component that sends users to a specified path without refreshing the page just like a route does. It is basically a replacement for an anchor tag. A route is similar but it decides which path should be navigated to based on the active url instead of a click event.
