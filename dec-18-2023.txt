I ended up starting a poster design randomly last night and I actually finished it today! This is probably my first time that i've completed a personal piece of work that i'm actually happy with. I feel like I was able to come up with some cool, unique typography ideas that made a pretty edgy looking piece. I bet i'll look back in the future and think it's bad but it's definitely a step forward right now. Tonight I will be moving forward in the typogarphy section of the illustrator course. I'm happy that type is being covered now as I learned how to browse the Adobe fonts inside of the software itself rather than have to only use the website. The website is nice for inspo though. This next section after typography is color which i've been looking forward to getting into.
