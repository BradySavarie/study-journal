Yesterdays coding session went great. I ended up getting the entire desktop version of the hero section done with the exception of some svg color changes between dark and light mode. I will sort that out today and then focus on making the page responsive. I think working on responsivness before moving onto the next section will probably help out as I don't want to get overwhelmed when I do finish all of the desktop sections up. There is still a lot of work to be done of course but i'm happy with how the site is progressing. One thought that I am having is that I will leave all of the main animations to be done once all of the section are developed. That will probably be my best bet as I will be able to see how everything feels without animation which can help me come up with ideas for how I want all of the elements to behave.

Hero section is fully responsive!! I have learned a heck of a lot about responsive design in the past few months which is super exciting. I didn't struggle all that much working with breakpoints and media queries tonight. I even have my dev server exposed to a local network so I can open it up on my mobile browser to confirm that everything is behaving as normal which is reassuring.

All that's left to do tonight is render my svg social icons conditionally depending on the color mode. Really quite proud of how this is turning out. Definitely my highest quality work yet from a design standpoint and user experience standpoint. 

Okay all done! Also styled up the download button hover states so at this point in pretty much 100% ready to move on to the next section which is the projects.
