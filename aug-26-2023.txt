Yesterdays coding session went great. I ended up getting the entire desktop version of the hero section done with the exception of some svg color changes between dark and light mode. I will sort that out today and then focus on making the page responsive. I think working on responsivness before moving onto the next section will probably help out as I don't want to get overwhelmed when I do finish all of the desktop sections up. There is still a lot of work to be done of course but i'm happy with how the site is progressing. One thought that I am having is that I will leave all of the main animations to be done once all of the section are developed. That will probably be my best bet as I will be able to see how everything feels without animation which can help me come up with ideas for how I want all of the elements to behave.
