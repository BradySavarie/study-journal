Last night was meh, I must have been tired! I fell asleep watching a video on hooks. I managed to learn about useState and useEffect though; I implemented a little example app to practice how both work. It just changes a divs background color on click. the color is saved as state, a function is defined that sets the state of color based on its current value, and the function is used as an event handler on a div with color set as the divs background color. When the div is clicked the function is called which changes the state triggering a re-render, calling useEffect again since the color is within its dependencies array. The old event listener is removed from the previous component and a new event listener is added to the most recent instance of the component.

Damn alot of progress in a short period of time tonight! I completely replaced all class components in the cv-builder project with functional components. Ran into zero issues somehow, it's pretty straightforward to do. I then implemented the download as pdf functionality using the html2canvas and jspdf libraries, and then I redployed the new updated site to gh pages. Awesome.
