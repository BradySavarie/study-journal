Guilty as it feels, this forced break is kind of nice. Creative cloud is still down and i've been taking the time to just recharge. I had that interview today and they basically did the whole bait and switch thing on me. Showed up to interview for a design position and they asked me to basically work in production at a lower seniority than what I have now. Nice.. the ad was completely off. Seemed like nice enough people but they need to get their shit together cause that was just awkard telling them that i'm not interested in the job right now. At least I made a connection in case things go sour with duplicators.
