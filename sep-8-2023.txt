Today i'm going to be studying and putting into practice more nodejs and express topics. I'll be starting things off with learning about view/templating engines. 

Looks like the technology that i'll be starting with is ejs (stands for embedded javascript). The purpose of it is to generate html dynamically using plain old javascript. Not to be confused with using template literals which uses javascript within html. The use case for ejs instead is more so when you are generating a bunch of html using javascript, like a dynamic list for example. You could use a for loop to create a bunch of list elements with javascript variables inserted as text content or whatever and the syntax would be nice and easy. The creatiion of html using javascript so that the html can be based on dynamic data.
