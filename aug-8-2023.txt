I only have about an hour tonight to spend on programming. I'm hoping to get the configuration of my portfolio project all worked out. I've listed out all of the things that i'd like to get functional, here it is:

    - react router
    - materialUI
    - material icons
    - styled components
    - engine for styled components
    - react testing library
    - jest dom
    - user events
    - vitest
    - eslint
    - prettier
    - any types dependencies
    - framer motion

Alrighty. As of now i've got material ui (including icons and styled components engine/library), eslint, prettier, and all of the typescript types worked out that are relevant to the currently installed dependencies. Next up I will test a dev server to make sure everything is working as intended. Once that is confirmed I will add in react router, and then I will research what kind of testing I should be doing for this app to decide how I want to approach unit tests. It doesn't seem necessary for a portfolio website but idk maybe it is.
