Yesterday was pretty tough so todays goal is to pick an easy win and try to get some momentum going again on the shopping cart project! I think i'm going to just style up the product page tonight and see how that goes. I'll leave a copy of the remaining tasks for reference: 

    - Write unit tests for each component
    - Instantiate and style product filtering component
    - Instantiate and style shopping cart component
    - Include hide/show shopping cart animation on click
    - Create add and remove items from cart functions
    - Hook up shopping cart logic to product cards, product page, and shopping cart components
    - Style not found page

Okay product page is all styled up. Took longer to get it looking sharp than I wanted but I think i've got the momentum started back up now so it was worth it! Css is tricky stuff, idk why people make it out to be easy. I know it's declarative so should be a simple thing but it definitely is not.
