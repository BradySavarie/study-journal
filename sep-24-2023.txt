So I ended up doing a little bit of research yesterday after failing to deploy my small project and it turns out that i'm not the only one who always runs into issues with deploying projects. It's actually an entire job in and of itself to manage the process, and is a huge part of dev ops. This makes me feel a little better because I recognize that whenever it is time to deploy I am always trying to rush through it as quick as possible to just get it done, but the truth is that it is a skill I will need to actually stop and focus on learning if I want to really get good at it and understand the process thoroughly.

Anyways, as mentioned previously I am going to follow the direction of the MDN tutorial series to host my project which will walk me through the basics of what I need to know. For now though I am learning about routes and controllers. Let's go.
