Okay i've got 2 hours and a half hours to get some work done, let's gooo! The goal is to figure out which components I will need to write for this cv application and decide what exactly the components will need to do. If I can come up with a solid plan than i'll be in alot better shape to move forward as i'm a little lost right now. I also would like to settle on a UI design concept so that I know what i'm attempting to create. I'll do that first by looking for some reference projects to base my design off of.

Okay so the main idea is to have two modes: edit and preview. You can switch between modes by clicking a toggle button.Edit mode will be selected by default. In edit mode you will see a form that is broken down into 5 main sections: personal information, experience, education, skills, and projects. Here is a breakdown of which fields each section contains:

Personal information

    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Photograph
    - Location
    - Phone Number
    - Email
    - Bio

Experience

    - Company
    - Title
    - Start Date
    - End Date
    - Description

    Add Experience Button
    Delete Experience Button

Education

    - School
    - Field of Study
    - Qualification
    - Enrollment Date
    - Graduation Date

    Add Education Button
    Delete Education Button

Skills

    - Description

    Add Skill Button
    Delete Skill Button

Projects

    - Title
    - Description
    - Live Link
    - Repository Link

    Add Project Button
    Delete Project Button


The personal information, experience, and education sections will be required but the skills and projects sections can be added and deleted in edit mode. This ensures that the resume that is built can be general purpose but also can be tailored to better suit developer jobs.

So in edit mode all of these fields are displayed as inputs that can be edited with custom information. The toggle to switch to preview mode is at the top of the screen. At the bottom of the screen there is a button to generate a sample resume using fake data and a reset button to clear out all of the data in the fields.

In preview mode, all of the data that is input in edit mode is displayed as a formatted resume layout. There will be a blank template shown that contains data to indicate where each field will be laid out without having to generate a full example and clear all of the fields. Underneath the previewed resume will be a generate pdf button that allows the user to export the file.


After breaking down the application above I think I have an idea of which components I will be needing to create and what their functionality will be. Here it is:

App

    - This component will be responsible for using state to manage which mode the application is in and store all of the sub-components values. This data can be passed down as props to each sub-component and used to conditionally render depending on the current mode.
    - This component will also contain functions for adding and removing resume sections, generating a sample resume, clearing out the data fields, and generating a pdf. These options will be conditionally rendered as well depending on the mode.
