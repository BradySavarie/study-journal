I think I may have missed my daily commit, however I did not miss the studying! I finished up the React introduction and found it interesting. I learned about components (both functional and class), how to setup a react application by using create-react-app, how to write jsx, and what state and props are. It got deeper than that of course but yea those were the main topics covered. I also researched exactly what it is the create-react-app is doing and think I have a good understanding of what is going on under the hood for the most part. I feel like I have a good grasp on everything that is contained within that lesson and i've started working on the next lessons which dives deeper into props and state. This should be an important one so i'm excited to learn about it. The idea of passing properties through components as well as their states is brilliant. I've been using MVC and found it to be tricky to manage state using vanilla javascript techniques so this entire thing is looking like such a solid approach to programming.
