Okay today i'm going to start building my first react app! I'm not expecting it to be too much of a challenge yet. The main focus is to build an app that renders an input and a button, and when the button is clicked the input content adds a task to an array and then renders the contents of that array to the screen. 

I'm going to be using create-react-app for this since it's quick and easy, and it will allow me to get a bit of experience using it at least before moving on to other react build tools like Vite. 


Task app is built, i've gotten my first taste of React! It is definitely going to take some time to get used to all of the new functionality but so far I really like it and see the value in mastering this framework. Using state right now is what is tripping me up, in prticular the setState method. The concept of state being immutable and only taking effect on the next render I think is what caused me issues but i'm feeling pretty good now. Figured out how to add unique numbers on to the front of the list items that i'm generating (simulating how an order list would look but using state for practice). An interesting problem that I ran into was trying to figure out how to create unique identifiers to use as keys since React makes you give each jsx element a unique key when iterating over it using array methods. I ended up using a handy little tool called uniqid that generates these id's for you by simply calling it using uniqid(). Easy.
