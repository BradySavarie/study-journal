So i'm feeling quite a bit better about MUI than I was while just learning on-the-go! I'm glad I stopped to read up on it and follow a little video series. I now understand alot of the core pieces of functionality and how I can leverage styled-components to write custom css within an mui component. I refactored a little bit of code last night, and todays goal is to figure out how to make a dark mode toggle switch as well as add in some sort of logo to identify the project. I think I will do some exploring to see which custom component would be most suitable for a basic header that contains a centered logo and a toggle switch on either side.

Holy man I finished up and got it deployed tonight! The deployment process was a git nightmare lol but I got it working finally. Deploying to gh-pages with ever-changing configurations is a minefield, it is a real victory when I finally get it working. 

So i'm pretty happy with the final product. The styling is very basic but clean and it has the full functionality. I skipped out on dark mode, flipping animations, and an instructions screen (dark mode looked bad, flipping was extra complications wihtout much return) and I feel okay about it. I can always extend functionality if I ever deem it important but i've spent alot of time styling this thing since I leanrned a whole new library and way of working. Either way i'd say this project was a success!

I would like to create the gh repository as soon as possible and get this solution posted on the odin project so I can move on cleanly. I also am going to fix up that knight-travails repo as It could use a little bit of work.
