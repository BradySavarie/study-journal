So i'm feeling quite a bit better about MUI than I was while just learning on-the-go! I'm glad I stopped to read up on it and follow a little video series. I now understand alot of the core pieces of functionality and how I can leverage styled-components to write custom css within an mui component. I refactored a little bit of code last night, and todays goal is to figure out how to make a dark mode toggle switch as well as add in some sort of logo to identify the project. I think I will do some exploring to see which custom component would be most suitable for a basic header that contains a centered logo and a toggle switch on either side.
