Time to get a drop on the members-only project! Feeling pretty good going into this. The first thing that I intend on doing is cleaning up/emptying out the existing repository and then creating my api and client directories. I can then configure the tech that I plan on using for both the client and api so that I can get the index and test routes setup for both. This way I should be able to run a server pointing to different localhosts for both the back-end and front-end
