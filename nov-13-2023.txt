Time to get a drop on the members-only project! Feeling pretty good going into this. The first thing that I intend on doing is cleaning up/emptying out the existing repository and then creating my api and client directories. I can then configure the tech that I plan on using for both the client and api so that I can get the index and test routes setup for both. This way I should be able to run a server pointing to different localhosts for both the back-end and front-end.

Okay i'm all configured now for the client side, and the api is created but I haven't done much work to it. The express app generator got me up and running with a test router though so I should be good to go. I accidentally pushed the node modules in my api to my remote repo but I found a good way to solve that problem! ALl I have to do is move the node modules to some temporary location outside of the git repo and stage the changes. Git records this as a deletion event and once the new commit is pushed the node modules folder is removed from the remote repo. It's then safe to move it back (ensuring that the gitignore has node modules included now of course). Pretty nifty little trick.
