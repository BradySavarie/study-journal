Yesterday turned out pretty good. I've got the majority of the projects section worked out, just have to add the technologies grid and the icon buttons below it to complete the card. Then ill just extract it as an component and include 3 of them with different information passed in as props. Should be pretty straightforward to finish up (I always say that... sometimes im right). The goal is to have a finished section by the end of the night. Tomorrow i'll make it responsive.
