Last night I ended up getting the project organized using express-app-generator. I now have a directory ready to go with pug and mongoose installed. I built a dev database as well and connected it. The project is pushed to github and ready now to actually be developed. Next order of business is to setup all of the routes in the catalog router. I can write the controller functions later on.

So far so good. I've got my router configured and im working on building out all of the routes. I currently have the effect routes all ready to go. I created controller functions that send string responses just to help with testing and to at least have that portion of the project prepared to be developed.
