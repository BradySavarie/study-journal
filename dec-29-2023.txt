I've gotten my start on the photoshop course. I am working through the section on color today! I will be learning about adjusting levels, vibrance, hue, etc. I will also be making photos black and white and working with gradients. Should be a fun section. I am really excited to become proficient in this software because I am really feeling the limitations right now. Last night I decided to take a crack at another poster design after downloading a collection of fonts that Jesse Nyberg suggets using and it actually turned out pretty darn cool! The only technique I really had at my disposal though for the image manipulation was using blend modes in illustrator which abviously is quite limiting. I'm sure illustator can do a lot more with images than that anyways, but now that i'll be learning Photoshop I will be able to take it alot further than what I am capable of at the moment. With poster design in paticular that uses bitmaps quite alot I imagine this will come in very handy.
