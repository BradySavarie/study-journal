At work today I had the idea that since I want multiple things to happen when I click on a card component (increment score, check game over, check new round, add card to selected list) I should create a handleSelectCard function that calls of the the necessary logic rather than try to bake it all into a single function. I will do that today first, and then once that is done I can focus on the logic that switches to the next round.

series of events:
    - card is clicked
    - check is card has already been selected
    - if yes update game over state, if no add to selected movies array
    - if game over is true call game over function, if not increment score
    - check if round is over
    - if yes increment round indicator, shuffle movies and new one to current movies array

I've got all of the above working. Next up is to track current and best score on click. I think i'll just create that handleSelectCard function now so that I can update the score states without having to keep them locked inside another function.
