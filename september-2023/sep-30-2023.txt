I've made it to the inventory application project. I need to make a decision on how I would like to approach this. While I would like to make a sign shop inventory management project, I need to think through how to actually structure all of those models which will be alot of work unrelated to programming. Perhaps a better use of my time right now would be to make this guitar pedal themed so that I can link it to my ecommerce-shop later on. I feel like that would probably be a better use of my time since it is more straight forward which models I will need and will help improve a past project. Once I get around to the full-stack projects I can make a sign-shop website that has inventory management built-in as well as an admin dashboard and authentication and what not.
