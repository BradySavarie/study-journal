Today I would like to work out 2 remaining problems with the api fetch code that I have written. First of all, I am unsure why the code returns the movies array with 25 objects when I save my code while the dev server is running yet when I hit refresh it only returns an empty array. Second, I am still getting a linting error. 

Alright both issues are fixed. I added a loading state that is initially true, which conditionally is rendered to display a loading screen. Once the data fetch is completed the loading state is set to false and the actual program will be rendered instead. I removed the rawMovieData state completely by opting to call the generateMoviesArray method within the api fetch function instead which simplified things further. Now whenever the page is refreshed the state of the movies array is updated to the newly returned json object without triggering another rerender in between. Works good. I see the loading screen and the returned data so no issues there. The linting error did persist so i've disabled it for that line. It is asking me to pass in a function as a dependency which causes an infinite loop so that's not going to fly. Can't find another way around it but since everything is working I think disabling is an okay way to go.
