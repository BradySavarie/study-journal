Tonight I have about 3 hours of studying to take advantage of. I am going to start by coming up with a vintage color scheme to work with and saving it within the mui theme. I learned how to work with the default themes spacing yesterday and don't see any need to change that up si I can check it off of the list. It feels cool to be mixing mui with styled components. It's such a powerful way to write css for a React application.

Once I have the color palette in place I can go ahead and continue with styling up the home page. I will need to work on the main call to action and include the categories navigation within the main nav bar. Once that is ready to go I will be able to move tot he shopping page and style up the individual product cards which will be stored in a grid. Next to the grid I will have a container for filtering the output by price and manufacturer. I can create that component as well, or alternatively I can move on with the actual logic for the shopping cart as I still haeven't gotten around to that yet and would like to get working on it. I am watching a video to get some ideas on how I can manage state for this app. The video uses context and I am interested to see how they approach implementing it. I am considering right now passing a context to just the shopping page but I still don't want to reload all of it with each update so that's not ideal. Anyways i'll take cue from that video to come up with an approach that works for my app.
