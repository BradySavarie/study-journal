Tonight I am going to try to keep things to less than two hours of study/programming. I have been getting to bed so late and it definitely affected the way I carried myself today at work. Gotta make sure I have the mental capacity tomorrow still to work efficiently. The goal for the next two hours or so is to finish restructuring edit mode and then connect previewMode to the new state data structure so that everything renders on click. I expect to still have some time left to begin including the add and delete buttons. I'd like to create an event handler for them that creates new objects and inserts them in state to be rendered, then deletes them on request.

Well things have been pretty smooth so far today. I've completed everything above besides deleting sections. Finishing up edit mode produced no new challenges. Including the add section buttons required a little bit of effort. I had to come up with a handler function that creates a new object based on a template of an existing component object (because every component contains different properties) and then ensure all of the fields are blank and it has a unique key. This object was then used to update state by spreading out the existing objects in an array and adding the new one on the end. Pretty simple, but I ran in to some syntax errors along the way that did trip me up. I'm getting the hang of class components at this point though I would say.
