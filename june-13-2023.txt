Tonight I am going to try to keep things to less than two hours of study/programming. I have been getting to bed so late and it definitely affected the way I carried myself today at work. Gotta make sure I have the mental capacity tomorrow still to work efficiently. The goal for the next two hours or so is to finish restructuring edit mode and then connect previewMode to the new state data structure so that everything renders on click. I expect to still have some time left to begin including the add and delete buttons. I'd like to create an event handler for them that creates new objects and inserts them in state to be rendered, then deletes them on request.
