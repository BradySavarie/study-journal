Okay i've got 2 hours and a half hours to get some work done, let's gooo! The goal is to figure out which components I will need to write for this cv application and decide what exactly the components will need to do. If I can come up with a solid plan than i'll be in alot better shape to move forward as i'm a little lost right now. I also would like to settle on a UI design concept so that I know what i'm attempting to create. I'll do that first by looking for some reference projects to base my design off of.

Okay so the main idea is to have two modes: edit and preview. You can switch between modes by clicking a toggle button.Edit mode will be selected by default. In edit mode you will see a form that is broken down into 4 main sections: personal information, experience, education, and skills. Here is a breakdown of which fields each section contains:

Personal information

    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Photograph
    - Address
    - Phone Number
    - Email
    - Bio

Experience

    - Company
    - Title
    - Start Date
    - End Date
    - Description
