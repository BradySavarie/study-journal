Okay time to get going! Today I am going to get a search input running in the main nav bar that renders the product page with the product that has been searched (by product name). Once that is up and running I would like to start creating the shopping cart logic. I am looking forward to that part as it allows me to think about how I want my applications state to be managed. I learned about the context api recently and i'm hoping I come acress a good use case in this application so that I can get some practice in. Ideally I would also like to configure MaterialUI and Styled Components in this project tonight but I think that would be biting off more than I can chew, I only have about 3 and a half hours until I have to turn in.
