This afternoon I am going to get my cv-builder project hosted on gh-pages and write the readme for it. Once that's done i'll submit it to TOP and move on to the lifecycle methods lesson. I already have read most of the articles within it so I expect to be able to do the included code-along and tie up that lesson pretty quickly as well. Next up will be studying hooks and then converting my cv-builder into functional components that use them! Pretty stoked to go through these next few lessons, I have heard alot about functional components and i'm looking forward to getting used to using them now. I'm hoping that the memory-cards project goes quickly though because I don't see where the value comes in with this one. I'm sure i'll learn some stuff but it will mostly be reinforcing what I know, and I don't think it is much of a portfolio piece but I could be wrong. Either way i'm liking the progress that is being made!
