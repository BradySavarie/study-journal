Learned some pretty sweet stuff last night. CC libraries are pretty awesome. They let you store graphics, fonts, colors, etc inside of a folder basically called a library that can be accessed via any Adobe app directly inside each software. Super convenient way to pass around different values that are used commonly. One great use case that I learned about last night was saving colour palettes in Adobe Color. Adobe color is a tool used for creating color schemes using color harmony or any visual inspiration that you find while exploring options based on text prompts or by checking out the trending options. You can click 'add to library' and then put that color palette up in illustrator really easily rather than creating a bunch of custom swatches. I really like this method of working with color.

I also learned how to work with gradients. Pretty easy, there is a tool specifically for it. All of the standard gradient options are available like the modes (radial and linear), adding stops, changing the colors out and choosing where the mid-points go. All that standard stuff. There is however a pretty cool tool that the course suggested called grabient that provides a bunch of nice gradient values to try out. I can use that in the future when I am looking for inspiration.
