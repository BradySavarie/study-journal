Spent a lot of time this afternoon researching how to automate business processes for work. Not programming, but the knowledge could come in handy down the line in related ways. In order to use many automating platforms you need to have a solid understanding of how to work with API's, so perhaps i'll be able ot put my development skills to use in that industry one day to save businesses a ton of time. Who knows. I found a way to do it for Duplicators by automatting the entire customer service/project management process up until the first contact is made with the customer which is pretty insane. A new email can trigger a task to be created in asana which is assigned to the person with the least amount of work in their queue. Then chatgpt can put together a draft response in and store it in the assigned workers folder in outlook. All the worker has to do is check which tasks they are assigned in asana and open up the related drafts in outlook to correct an inaccuracies in chatgpt's generated response. This can improve response rates and turnaround times for orders dramatically. There is also a docketmanager integration available but it is quite limited. I was hoping to be able to create an empty quote and attach the quote number as reference in the email draft so all of these resources can be linked together and ready to go. Don't think that extended functionality is available yet though. Too bad that Zapier can be so pricey.. it would be a tough sell to convince the bosses to actually invest in it. I may approach the topic when the business reaches a point where the workload is heavy enough to justify hiring on another person. It will make sense to first invest in improving efficiency at that point rather than starting with increasing capacity. Training and turnaround costs can be avoided if successful.
