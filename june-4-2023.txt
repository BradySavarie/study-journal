Last night I worked through the remaining Git lesson that taught the standard workflow for contributing to open source projects. I learned about the 'git triangle' concept, which describes the relationship between the upstream, forked/origin, and local repositories. Pretty neat stuff. The contributing process goes like this:

Find an open-source github repository that you would like to contribute to. Fork the repository so that you have a remote copy of it in your github called origin. Clone the remote forked repository (origin) onto your local device so you can work on it. Before starting work, create another remote branch called upstream that points to the repository that you are contributing to. You can't push directly to this repo because you do not have write access, but you can pull data from it. Now you are ready to work so you can create a local feature branch and make all the necessary changes to it. You can assume that your local copy is out of sync with the upstream repository because it is likely that changes have been made to it by other contributors while you were working on your feature. Before pushing any changes up to origin you are going to want to fetch the data from the upstream repo and merge it into the main branch of your local repository. Since your feature branch is considered 'dirty' at this point (it may contain merge conflicts with main) you are going to want to merge main into it instead of the other way around. This ensures that you have a conflict-free merge process ahead and is good practice anytime you are merging into more senior-branches. Resolve any conflicts that arise now. Your feature branch is now considered clean and will merge into main, therefore you are good to push the branch up to your remote repository origin and submit it as a pull request to the upstream repo. 

Little side note: it seems counter-intuitive that you want to push data to a repository yet are submitting a pull request to do so. The reason for this is because what you are actually doing is requesting that the owner of the repository pulls your data into their project. .
