Made alot of progress yesterday! I have my login and logout functions completely worked out now so I think that covers all of the authentication work. I feel good about learning json web tokens, it's really not that complicated of a process. Passport has a strategy for it but honestly I don't think I really need a framework for it anyways. That's coming from a noob though, maybe the framework has more functionality attached to it that I am unaware of. 

I start working on the main functionality of the application today starting with the places/accommodations form. Should be interesting. The person who put together the tutorial (channel Coding With Dawid) has an incredible way of focusing on the task at hand and knows what to do and how to do it at basically all times. Really quite inspiring to see somebody so capable of understanding what needs to get done and knowing how to do it. Hopefully one day I am at that level of competency. Watching him work is great for teaching me how to approach problems and what order I should be doing things in. There has been alot of advice online regarding not following tutorials however I feel as if I am getting alot out of this. Maybe i'm being tricked, I guess when I go to build my own project I will find out.
