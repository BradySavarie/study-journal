I finished the update functionality yesterday and also included delete and start options for the upload photos component. You can click a start icon to make it the 'main' image, which just shifts it to the front of the added photos array so that it is displayed first. I used a put request for the first time in order to update existing data. I don't entirely understand why I couldn't have just used a post request to be honest, I think i'm going to start todays session by researching that in a little bit more depth! ON the bright side though I am finding myself getting the hang of this full-stack thing. It all makes a lot more sense after putting it into practice. I am just communicating back and forth between a client and server using http requests. It's just about bundling up the correct information and making sure that the api handles it and responds as intended. Obviously a lot more nuance than that haha but I don't know why it was such an intimidating thing when really it's all just programming. The back-end is much harder from a logic perspective, but css (and to a certain extent javascript) is honestly a tricky beast to tame as well so it's not as if that difficulty level has increased exponentially so far. Same language and everything luckily! Thank you whoever developed NodeJS!!
