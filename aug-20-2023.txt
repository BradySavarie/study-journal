Tonight i'm going to be focusing on making the navbar mobile friendly! I want the container that holds all of the functionality (navlinks, color mode toggle, and download resume button) to be hidden when a small breakpoint is reached and instead a hamburger menu icon be put in it's place. When the button is clicked a drawer should open that displays all of those same controls.

Okay we're in good shape! I've got the hamburger menu being displayed at the correct beakpoints, and all of the other functionality is being hidden at the complimentary breakpints. The hamburger menu icon is clickable and it opens a drawer. The drawer still needs to be styled up. Soon that drawer will have all of the functionality put within it so that it replaces the navbar on mobile. Pretty nifty feature.
