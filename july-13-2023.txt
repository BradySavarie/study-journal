I'm going to start today with creating a product card component that is rendered dynamically within the shop page rather than just rendering the product names. Once that is done I will set up the cards to route to a product page on click that displays more product information. Below the product will be a 'similar products' section that shows a selection of product cards from the same category. No styling will be done for any of this, just barebone jsx being rendered that is fully functional. Once that is all working I can add a search input to the navbar that takes you to the matching product page when you click a button or hit enter. I can expand on this feature later if I want to display a list of products that match the input string as its being typed to assist in finding the correct product.

The last feature I will implement is the actual shopping cart itself. There will be an icon in the navbar that shows/hides a shopping cart component. It could render as a sidebar to the right of the screen once styled. Within the shopping cart should be a list of items currently in the cart (each with a function to update the quantity of the item), a number of items field, a subtotal, a total, and a checkout button. I could implement the checkout page in the future if I choose to but for now this button will remain inactive.


Alright so a few hours later and i've made some good progress. I have my product card components and they are all rendering on the shop page. When you click on them you navigate over to a product page that shows the product that was clicked with a 'similar products' section underneath it that renders other products in the same category. I also went ahead and sourced images for each of the products that are being rendered along with the data inside each product card. Pretty awesome seeing it all come together so quickly. Tomorrow I will get the search input working and then i'll build out the shopping cart component.
