Going to be working on the about section of the portfolio today! Shouldn't be too time consuming as it is mostly just text. Can't wait to finish up this portfolio and officially move on to the back-end! Having this site in my back pocket is going to be an awesome resource as I start building out full stack apps since I will be able to constantly be showing my best work to employers in a professional way that extends beyond just my github account. Once I have a few full-stack projects ready to go the appliying process begins! Obviously i've still got months until reaching that point since this projects will be very involved but it's exciting to reach that point for sure. Gives me a nice goal to work towards as well. I think creating a linkedIn and a nice resume will be something I do while putting these projects together to make sure i'm even more prepared when the time does come. I will probably be pushing the cv builder project out so im not going to worry much about making sure that my resume is created with it.
