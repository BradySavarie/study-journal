Been out of the house since 1pm, currently 11:00pm. Not ideal for learning but hey i've done pretty darn good all of my vacation so i'm not too stressed about it. Going to jump into the photoshop course now and learn a bit about text and layer styles. I'm already feeling a bit more comfortable in the software which is pretty great. I'm mostly looking forward to getting the hang of masking/selections and applying some cool styles like halfone and gradient maps. I'd like to be able to jump back and forth to illustrator and photoshop seamlessly when working on a project. I am wondering if the Adobe Bridge will be able to help me with that or not.. I hear it's for asset management but don't know much else about it.
