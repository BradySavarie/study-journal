I've got an interview scheduled tomorrow for a photographer/videographer job, and I think I may be able to sell my web development skills to give me a better chance at landing it! It's in the real estate business and i'm thinking that building personal listing sites may be something they are interested in. That would be a really great way to get some real experience to leverage later on to actually get into web dev. Figured i'd mention that here cause i'm excited about the opportunity.
