I've got an interview scheduled tomorrow for a photographer/videographer job, and I think I may be able to sell my web development skills to give me a better chance at landing it! It's in the real estate business and i'm thinking that building personal listing sites may be something they are interested in. That would be a really great way to get some real experience to leverage later on to actually get into web dev. Figured i'd mention that here cause i'm excited about the opportunity.

Today I plan on making some progress with the members-only application. I'm going to use what i've learned in the last airbnb project to help me decide what to do first. I remember once the project configuration was ready to go the first thing that I did was build out the registration process. First I will need to put together a route that opens up the registration page. I will use basically the same styling just with some adjustments of course such as a different logo and removal of the search bar. I will extract the nav into it's own component again.
