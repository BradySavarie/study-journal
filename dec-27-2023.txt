I just finished recreating 3 logos fromt the angular section of the logo modernism book. It was pretty fun. I have found that by using rectangular grids and dividing them up into whichever number of segments best fits the graphic I am able to pretty easily recreate these geometric forms. The angular section is almost all based on squares and rectangles though so this type of grid based aproach lends itself really well to this specific type of logo. There are some logos included in this section that don't fit a cookie-cutter rectangular grid and I think I am going to enjoy creating those ones. One challenge that i've been aving consistently is figuring out how to build shapes using strokes as the white space. It was a technical challenge to figure out how to remove the stroke on only certain segments of a line for example to keep the spacing consistent. When two shapes are put next to each other with the same stroke you get either double the spacing or an overlapping stroke depending on how you place them so this has to be dealt with by expanding the shape and using the shapebuilder tool to remove and/or combine certain segements. I also learned that when using the shapebuilder tool you should overlap the segments that you want to subtract purposefully rather than connect them edge-to-edge because most times a tiny little 1 pixel line is left over due to a misalignment or what have you and it leads to some tricky problems after that fact with removing anchor points and what not.
