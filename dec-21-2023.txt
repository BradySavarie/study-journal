I'm feeling guilty about being away for web development for this extended period of time! Really hoping that this time focusing on design is going to pay off. It feels like i'm grinding in a video game and my attack level was getting way too far behind my defense levels or something so I end up handicapped. I'd like to have a nice balance between both skill sets. Maybe that's why I feel guilty - I am neglecting one aspect of my skills. Either way, in order to make my next dev project I will need to first design it. If I can perhaps learn some UI design after illustrator that could be a nice way of ensuring that I keep on the right track. I want to do photoshop and inDesign pretty badly though haha.

Today at work I was able to use photoshop to solve problem! It was alot of fun. A customer dropped off a piece of cloth with a graphic on it that he wanted to turn into a vinyl decal. Usually I would go through the process of attempting to vectorize the graphic using whatever techniques are most suitable, but this time around I decided to scan the cloth and manipulate the bitmap file. It had a bunch of rips in it, was missing small pieces of the graphic, and had a really rough edge that resulted in no bleed. I was able to use content-aware fill and the patch tool to handle all of those problems. It was excellent to have those powerful tool available to make the job so easy. And now I have a graphic that includes a rally interesting texture within it rather than just a vector on a white backgrond. Not that one is necessarily better than te other, but in this case it turned out nice.
