today i'm finishing up the aria lessons additional resources. I want to get more familiar with the concepts via repitition. In addition to that i'd like to start into the lesson on accessibility auditing. I think it will be nice to know exactly how to approach testing my site for a11y rather than just trying to remember all the different steps that I could take. I heard something about a plugin that ensures a website follows WCAG AA compliance kind of like how a linter would work, so that would be a nice tool to have.
