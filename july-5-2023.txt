Woo still celebrating finishing up the memory-cards app last night! Started looking into React Routers today and it seems like a straight forward concept. I am going to draft the README today for memory-cards and then go through the react router lesson in the odin project. Pretty excited to be moving forward with the React section now. I want to get around to that shopping cart app already, it looks like a fun and highly applicable one.
