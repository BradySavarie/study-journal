Woo still celebrating finishing up the memory-cards app last night! Started looking into React Routers today and it seems like a straight forward concept. I am going to draft the README today for memory-cards and then go through the react router lesson in the odin project. Pretty excited to be moving forward with the React section now. I want to get around to that shopping cart app already, it looks like a fun and highly applicable one.

Ouf I just ran into a major issue! For some reason the class movies api was completely removed from the website when I opened up the application today. I was receiving a CORS error at first which was confusing because cross origin resouce sharing must have been enabled on the server if it has been working this whole time. I figured at first that perhaps deploying to github pages created an issue with the origin not being accepted, but then I visited the api website and noticed it was completely gone. No idea what happened there. Maybe I was making too many requests and then mod shut it down? Not sure haha. 

I found the project on github thankfully and was able to locate a copy of the json object I was fetching. I copied the relevant data into a local directory and imported it into my project instead of fetching it and luckily this did the trick. That would have really sucked if I completely lost access to the api data! I have redeployed the update and everything is in working order again, but I have been set back about 2 hours or so.
