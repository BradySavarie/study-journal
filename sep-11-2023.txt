Game plan: make as much progress as possible on the MongoDB University introduction course. Tonight is going to be all about databases. Pretty excited to finally get to dive into this world a little bit. Only took 10 months of studying just about every single day to get to it haha. 

Going well so far. I'm on the 3rd unit out of 12. The course has covered the very basics like what mongoDb atlas is vs what a mongoDb database is. Atlas is a cloud-based developer data platform that wraps around the your mongoDb databases. Therefore the database can be thought of as being at the core of MongoDb Atlas. Some functionality that is provided is data analytics and searching/filering for example. We've also covered the differences between databases, collection, and documents in MongoDB. About to learn more about the document model now, which is the basic unit of data store essentially. It is similar to json but stores any data type from what I can tell so far.
