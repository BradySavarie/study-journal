Long day of working out, running errands, and auditioning vocalists for the band. Not much time left in between to do any studying. On the bright side though I did secure an interview for a design and development oriented position for next week. The pay is pretty decent, however there are alot of red flags. I've interviewed here before (Modern Signs) and got a weird vibe from the owner. He didn't show up and he was texting me really late in an informal way. It could still be a good resume piece though and let me earn more money than I would at duplicators. If it is terrible I could always wait it out until september and then find a part time job while i go back to finish my degree. Not a bad depending on how tolerable the job would be haha. Going to meet with him anyways and talk it out.
