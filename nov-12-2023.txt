Today the goal is to finish up the airbnb project. Sitting in a coffee shop right now and have less than an hour of the video left. Should be able to get it done!

Done. Heck yea. It's nearly 1am but I just wrapped up the project. Even though it was a tutorial I feel great about having a full-stack project under my belt. I understand pretty much all of the concepts that were covered and have a feeling that I actually did learn alot and will be able to implement my own project sing the stuff that I learned. Time not to move forward with the members only project to prove that to myself and get it out of the way! I don't think it will be too time consuming unless I allow myself to get too caught up in the details of what the UI looks like.
