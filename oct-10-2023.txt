Going to make those controller functions now for the category model. It's the last thing to do until this inventory project is finished up! Awesome. 

Looking forward to learning about authentication after this. I kind of miss the front-end, and i'm a little concerned the my skills are fading as I haven't been using all of the front-end tech while studying the back-end. Hopefully i'll be able to learn how to integrate everything together soon to truly make a full-stack application. That is going to be a cool mission to accomplish.

Project is done! Nice, that was a good review. I feel like a have a solid enough grasp on every step of that process to be able to use the concepts to build something myself. Weak point is definitely using pug and mongoose as there are many different elements and methods that im not aware of. That will come with time though im sure.
