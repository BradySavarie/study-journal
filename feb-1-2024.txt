Man i've had the software back up and running for 4 days now and i've done absolutely nothing. This is the lowest point i've been at in the last year. I think my problem is that I don't have a goal that I believe in right now. I feel like the never ending grind has really been burning me out and I have found myself asking what i'm even doing it for. Learning new skills is awesome, but it has really come at a cost. Having a little bit of free time to just unwind feels like it's important, but not too much because then it is just time wasted. I need to figure out how to create a better balance for myself, and I need a new goal that I feel really motivated to accomplish (or at the very least see alot of value in achieving).
