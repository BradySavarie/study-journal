Man i've had the software back up and running for 4 days now and i've done absolutely nothing. This is the lowest point i've been at in the last year. I think my problem is that I don't have a goal that I believe in right now. I feel like the never ending grind has really been burning me out and I have found myself asking what i'm even doing it for. Learning new skills is awesome, but it has really come at a cost. Having a little bit of free time to just unwind feels like it's important, but not too much because then it is just time wasted. I need to figure out how to create a better balance for myself, and I need a new goal that I feel really motivated to accomplish (or at the very least see alot of value in achieving).

I'm not really sure what that goal is right now. I think i'm aiming towards marketing, but there is some cognitive dissonance that has been building up with the idea. My concerns are that I don't like social media or the whole constantly being connected to the public kind of vibe, and i'm afraid that a large investment into school will put me further into debt without increasing my earning potential significantly. Marketing in the entry level is pretty low salary for the most part, and the opportunities here in town are quite slim. It's a bit of a gamble but perhaps that is for the best because I do not want to be a production worker in print forever.

I may be a little lost right now but I am still earning money and gaining experience. By the time I get into school in September I will have 3 years of relevant experience, $15,000 saved to help get me through, and some marketable hard skills that I worked my butt off to develop and are adjacent to the marketing industy. Could be a heck of a lot worse than that.
