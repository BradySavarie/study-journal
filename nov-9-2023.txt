I ended up starting into the api section of the top briefly last night. Looks like it will be interesting - i'm basically learning it already as I make this project so that is nice. I will be looking at topics like different types of http requests, what the jamstack is, how cors works, etc. 

Tonight though im going to focus on the single place page of the airbnb app. Getting started now.
