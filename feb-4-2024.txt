Ouf, yesterday was the second day recently of missing my journal entry. Not doing well here at all in regards to making progress. Studying has been entirely halted. Hard time get any motivation left to actually work when I don't know what i'm working towards anymore. I'm feeling really uncertain of what the future is going to hold. I haven't even really decided if i'm going to be going back to studying everyday to be honest.. I really need a vision in order to continue making that schedule work for me.
