A little late so i'm not going to spend much time catching up in the journal today. Game plan is to continue with the 3 remaining sub-sections of the working with forms section in the library project. Let's go.

Alright so I made it through all of the remaining sub-sections and have got halfway through the end of lesson challenges. At the moment I am being challenged to implement the delete and update functionality for all of the objects in the application. It's pretty fun, i've gotten everything sorted out for deleting besides book instances (the easiest one since there are no dependencies to worry about). Tomorrow I will finish that and then start adding all of the updating functionality as well. Once that is done I will be finished this whole forms section and feeling pretty darn good! These challenges are nice because they force you to implement the solution yourself which really does ensure that you understand what you are doing. Looking forward to finishing them up and then learning about deployment.
