10 months of coding today. Only 2 months away from doing this just about every day for a year. Nice.

Game plan right now is to dive into the technologies section of my portfolio tonight. I did some research last night on how other people approach it and honestly got alot of conflicting feedback. People in general really don't like the whole '100% javascript, 50% react, etc.' concept. I completely agree - don't think it provides an accurate description of your skillset and can easily disqualify you if you rate yourself too low on something that a recruiter/employer cares about. And if you rate yourself high than you better be an expert. No winning there. Maybe people opted not to list a technologies section at all, while others listed everything they've ever used. I've considered not listing one since my projects already have all of the tech listed on each card, however it is nice to have the additional design element to break up my projects and about section and I want to have the key words that recruiters are looking for front and center so it can't be missed. Won't take too long anyways I don't think. I intend on listing just the technologies that I feel comfortable using and have a good amount of experience with, and the more experimental stuff can be included on a case by case basis within the projects section.

Finished up the skills section pretty darn quickly! Built a custom component that lets me input the relevant information as props which really cleaned the code up and should make the project easily maintainable. Everything is full repsonsive, dark mode ready and works on mobile browsers without issue. Only the personal info, contact, and footer sections left until i'm good to deploy!
