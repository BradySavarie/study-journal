Made it through the type section of the illustrator course yesterday! There was a big disappointment that I ran into. Turns out you can't break text apart into lines, words, or characters in AI without converting the text to outlines. This seems insane to me that illustrator doesn't have this functionality built-in. It has been a core feature of CorelDraw that I use in my work daily to ensure that text stays editable. This will create so many problems when coming back to old files for reorders or to look at what fonts were used previously. The only way around this is to make duplicates of the text before breaking it apart I suppose, that way you can use it as a reference later on if need bed. Seems like a bad workflow to me though compared to what i'm used to. I guess softwares can't be compared one-to-one and come out equal in everyway but I am actually shocked that this seemingly simple action hasn't been included in the industry-preferred software this whole time. I did find a script online that I can learn how to load into illustrator and run in order to make this functionality possible but having to run some random script that I found on a forum as a macro just seems silly for what this software costs.
