Last day of July! I believe that puts me at the 9 month mark of learning to code now which is pretty darn cool. I wish I had known how to use github from day one so I could see exactly which day I started learning, but November 1st of 2022 is my closest estimate. Come a long way from where I started, and incredibly i'm still just as dedicated as I was when I began. When it comes to career aspirations I am pretty used to trying something out and learning that it isn't something that I care to continue with for whatever reason, but that hasn't happened at all with coding. I believe strongly that no matter how long it takes to make this a career it will genuinely be worth it in the end, and since I know how it feels to have doubts about what i'm pursuing this feels really special to me. I've struggled for what feels like my entire adult life to find a suitable career path and i'm thrilled that I think I actually have managed it now. All I have to do is keep working hard and maintaining consistency and I will finally be able to overcome the struggle of starting a real career. The over saturation of the market is intimidating and I know it won't be easy at all when it comes time to look for a position, but i'm preparing well for the challenge so eventually it will fall into place.

Anyways, today
