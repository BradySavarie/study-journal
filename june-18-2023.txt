Last night I had finished styling up the edit mode of my cv builder program. I'm getting a lot more comfortable using styled-components and I actually don't mind the workflow now that I am getting used to it. Having to build a component for containers is a little bit annoying, i'm wondering whether or not there is a good workaround for that problem that does not involve having to use inline-styles. 

I just got curious and researched it. One possible solution is creating a generic container styled component that accepts props that represent the css values i want to set such as display, width, height, etc. and then each time I use the components I can pass in unique values to conditionally style it. This is a pretty good solution I think, although it closely resembles inline-styles still which is a bit off putting. I don't like to have a bunch of styling information inside of the js itself. 

Woo! I finished up the cv-builder project just now. Well.. kind of. All that is left is creating a function that downloads the contents of the preview mode container as a pdf. I did my research and know how I will implement it. I've already got the libraries installed to make it happen but unfortunately it only works properly inside of functional components as it the libraries are hook-based. I know that I will be coming back to this project in two lessons to convert it to functional rather than class-based components so I feel good with waiting until then to make the download pdf functionality work. I will save a link for now to the correct resource in the directory so i can reference it when need be.
