DAMN officially missed a day of programming. Had no choice but to focus on the bands first show all day yesterday so it's justified but still kind of a bummer! Oh well, the show goes on.

I think this afternoon i'd like to work on the portfolio project a little bit and perhaps put some time into the node.js course depending on how things go. I am going to start by filling out the light mode color palette so that I can use it to develop the remaining sections of the website. Now that I have the navbar and color mode toggle all set I imagine that development progress will move quicker. 

I spent a couple of hours styling up the navbar and fighting to make it responsive. It was tough.. I couldnt use devTools very well to test it since when I opened up devTools my breakpoint was not accessible. Finally figured it out using the mui docs and now have a responsive navbar that is still just like my figma reference. Next up is to have it display a hamburger menu at another breakpoint and show a drawer on click that contains all of the navbar related content within it. This will be a nifty way to make the site feel great on every screensize possible. Feeling pretty good now that I have it working. I am using the sx prop quite alot right now for prototyping, I think I might abstract some styles out into styled components to clean up the code but I want to get everything working properly first.
