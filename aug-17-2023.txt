Super busy day with band but I got a little bit of reading done at work at least! I am 3 lessons into the node.js course, I looked into some details on env variables and how to install and run node. I already use it of course so I don't need to go through any installation process, and i'm familiar with npm, but there is a lot more functionality that i have no clue about. Using http and the filing systems will be a big topic to get into im sure.

In regards to the portfolio project, no progress today. Literally no available time which is a shame, I don't like zero progress days! It's curently almost midnight so i'll be up another hour or so, at least I have a chance now to put a bit of work in.
