Damn I don't like missing days, yesterday was disappointing.

* Note that the start game button will notify the game controller module via event listener that a new game is starting. This function will in turn communicate with a new battleScreen view module and whatever other model modules it needs to prepare the game for user input.

    - listen for clicks
    - when clicked, validate that all ships are placed on board
    - if true call renderComputerGameboard

    - replaces inner html of main__placement-controls container with a container to contain the computers gameboard
    - dynamically render computers gameboard to the screen
    - Display an instructions header/footer to tell the player to click to shoot their cannon

    Time to implement the above functinonality so I can get the game loop logic put together.
