Damn I don't like missing days, yesterday was disappointing.

* Note that the start game button will notify the game controller module via event listener that a new game is starting. This function will in turn communicate with a new battleScreen view module and whatever other model modules it needs to prepare the game for user input.

    - listen for clicks
    - when clicked, validate that all ships are placed on board
    - if true call renderComputerGameboard

    - replaces inner html of main__placement-controls container with a container to contain the computers gameboard
    - dynamically render computers gameboard to the screen
    - Display an instructions header/footer to tell the player to click to shoot their cannon

    Time to implement the above functinonality so I can get the game loop logic put together.


Okay, above pseudocode has been implemented! Looks pretty good, i'm all set now to get started with actually implementing the game loop which is exciting. I've noticed with this project that i'm not getting stuck nearly as much as on previous projects. I know how to accomplish a lot of tasks that before I was very unclear about which is a nice accomplishment. I'm also alot more willing to make code that works regardless of if it is the most optimized version or not. I can come back and improve on it later but putting something together that does the job and not worry too much about it being perfect seems to be a good way to make progress as opposed to over thinking every detail before building. One problem at a time!
