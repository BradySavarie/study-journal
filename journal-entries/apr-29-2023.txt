Okay time to get going. I am at Salute and i'm going to stick around until I have the isBalanced and rebalance functions for the binary search tree created. I'm not expecting the difficulty level to be too high, let's see if that holds up.

I have yet to do the rebalance function, however i've made alot of progress regardless. I've decided that I want to showcase my ability to do data structures and algorithms to employers so i've moved my this BST repository into my projects, pushed it to github, and started writing a readme to describe the program. I've also spent some time reviewing and refactoring the other methods to make them more efficient and ensure that I understand precisely how they work. I'm considering doing the same thing to the linked list repository, i'm not sure why I decided in the first place to keep it stored in my practice repo. I suppose neither are necessarily web-dev based but it's still something that many employers could be interested in seeing. In addition to this, I could create a directory for data structures and and a directory for algorithms instead of unique directories for each project. I can then add in my related projects as I go. Doesn't seem like a bad idea.
