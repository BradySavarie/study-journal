Last night I had a heck of a time trying to figure out how to check is a ship is sunk and then render the status properly. Todays goal is to make that happen. Once I do that I can go ahead and figure out the logic for checking the end game conditions. I also realized that I have yet to make the computers AI smart.. like at all haha, it is currently just copying the position that the user clicks.
