Today i've spent some time studying and practicing recursion. It is such as interesting topic, but god damn is it hard to write recursive procedures. It's not so bad when the algorithm doens't require alot of calls, but once the stack starts getting big it can be very tricky to keep up with what is going on. I can only imagine trying to manage a function with several recursive cases.

Anyways, i've moved on to the recursion project section now where i'll be creating a Fibonacci function and a merge sort function. I've studied both of these previously but I can't recall whether or not I was using iterative thinking. Either way I believe it will be a good challenge and it will be nice to not have to concern myself over front-end design at all. First things first is reading all of the provided resources so this may take a little while yet.
