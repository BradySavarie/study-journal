I finished up the git lesson yesterday and ive let it sink in a bit today. I understand branching a whole lot better now. I have a good grasp on merging and rebasing. In addition to that I know how to amend and edit commits (the most recent and/or any in the repo history), and howt o reset and revert them. Feeling pretty good about that lesson. I'm going to try and get the first lesson in the testing section done now, I figure it can't hurt to run through both sections at the same time considering they address entirely different topics.

I have watched a video that discussed in detail why testing exists and I feel like I have more of a reason to focus on it now that I have an idea of why it is useful. Even though a certain piece of code may be simple, that doesn't mean it can't quickly grow in complexity. Having tests in place to ensure that the increasing complexity of my code does not overwhelm me or other developers will be very beneficial. I'm going to study how to actually do unit testing now.
