Alright this afternoon i'm going to implement the rotate function. Should be fun. Did quite a bit of prep work for it yesterday night so I should be able to get some good progress done within the hour or so that I have available to me.

Here is the pseudocode that I wrote up last night:

Change orientation steps:

    + attach an event click (or double-click) event to each cell of the gameboard on initial render
    + if the shipPositions array at the cells location contains a value that is not null than call rotate

    - rotate function selects the ship at the index stored in shipPositions array
    - call changeOrientation on ship
    - replace all index values in shipPositions array that match the ship with null
    - call placeShip method 
    - if successful, render gameboard
    - if not, changeOrientation back to normal and return

    break the above steps into smaller functions (as pure as possible for testing)


So far so good! i'm on the final conditional checks at the moment to see if the placement is valid or not. I need to find a way to reverse the changes to the shipPositions array if the placement is deemed invalid, or perhaps even find a way to do the check beforehand.

Rotate is done! It's working cleanly, doesn't seem to contain any bugs at this point in time (that i'm aware of, that is). I'm merging the dragndrop branch into main now and pushing to github.

My commits are pretty messy - i'm glad I've incorporated branching into my workflow successfully but I need to get better at either creating more targetted commits or going back and rewriting history. Or both, but ideally option A. 

Tests are written now as well for rotate. Just two simple ones that verify if a valid rotation occues and if an invalid rotation is handled properly.
