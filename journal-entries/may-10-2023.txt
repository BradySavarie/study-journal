Last night I had started making decisions on how to split up the code for the battleship game. I have some model, view, controller directories ready to go and have started figuring out which files will be contained within the model directory. So far im working with ship, board, and game modules. They each store and manipulate the applications data. The ship module has a ship class that contains properties and methods that help with creating and updating ship information, the board module handles all data that is related to the gameboard, and the game module handles information that is directly related to the state of the game itself.

Todays goal is to hook up a remote repo for battleship, continue configuring typescript and jest, and start writing up some tests for the models so that I can begin fleshing out the logic of the game. I'm hoping that throughout this process I will get a clearer picture on what problems will need to be solved to get this application working so that I can refine the pseudocode and begin coding.
