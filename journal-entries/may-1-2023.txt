Yesterday I had somehow managed to complete the knights travail project. Shocked myself with that, although I admit that I used many external resources to help me. I think it may be a good idea to review the code in detail or even rewrite it so that I can ensure I really understand every aspect of what is going on. I was running through it in my brain today and I feel like I do have a good grasp of how it all works though so I have confidence that I learned alot in the making of the project.

Besides mentally reviewing the knights travails program, I had also began considering whether I should do the intermediate git or the TDD section first. I am leaning towards learning more about git right now because I really would like to improve my understanding of the whole system and the section itself is shorter. Test driven development sounds cool too, however it has 2 projects so I am assuming it will take awhile (especially since one is battleship which is notorious in the odin project community as being amongst the most difficult in the entire course). Improving my git skills first will allow me to put what I learn to practice right away on these upcoming projects, so I think that may be the route i'm going to take. Can't wait to be done both of these sections though to be honest because up next is finally React! I've been looking forward to learning React for quite awhile now and reaching the section will definitely feel like a milestone has been hit.
