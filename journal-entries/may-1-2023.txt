Yesterday I had somehow managed to complete the knights travail project. Shocked myself with that, although I admit that I used many external resources to help me. I think it may be a good idea to review the code in detail or even rewrite it so that I can ensure I really understand every aspect of what is going on. I was running through it in my brain today and I feel like I do have a good grasp of how it all works though so I have confidence that I learned alot in the making of the project.
