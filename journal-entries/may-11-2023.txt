Currently on a work trip so it's been a little tricky squeezing time in for coding, hoever it's a little past 10 and i've found myself in a bar able to focus for a while! Quick mental recap: i've configured jest and typescript, and i've written the first test for my ship module. I don't have the ability right now to use audio so my typescript video series is out of the cards for studying tonight. I think refining the pseudo code for this project would be a good way to spend my time. I don't want to go to far into the coding until I know exactly what i'm trying to accomplish.
