Today i'd like to complete the takeTurn functionality. There's quite a bit of logic packed into that single function and i'm not sure what unexpected surprises will come up, but maybe i'll get lucky and it will be easy. Who knows.

Well it certainly wasn't easy but i've gotten alot done today! Most of the problems that I ran into centered around rendering different states. I had to change quite alot about how I used classes to render the cells, I now have a fully-functioning model that uses background colors to indicate that attackStat of each cell. They load up blue by default, if a human gameboard cell has the class containsShip it is orange, and 'hit' or 'miss' classes are added dynamically on each turn that renders different colors (not sure what I want them to be yet exactly but im testing with grey and red). I wrote the takeTurn function to be recursive and make use of setTimeout to simulate another player making a decision. This idea worked out pretty great, i'm happy with it. It's neat that a single click of the computers gameboard runs both players turns without the need to invoke a separate function.

Tomorrow I would like to lock in the styling choices, find a good favicon (not many options online that I liked), add a status header that shows the results of each turn in text, and write a function that checks the end game conditions. This should be enough to keep me busy for the afternoon. If I hapen to sort it all out quickly I can also design the end game screen UI as well as render the sunken ships. I think after that all I will have left is writing the documentation and publishing it all to github pages. Heck yea, this was my favourite project so far. Lot's of growth happened over the past 2-3 weeks of working on it.
