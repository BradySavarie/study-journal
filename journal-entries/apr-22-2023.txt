I'm currently in a coffee shop and all of the required materials for the data structures & algorithms lesson that im' working on requires watching videos. I think I may focus on that this afternoon and instead practice writing some sorting algorithms for a little bit. I did merge sort the other day which was alot of fun so I think it would be beneficial to toss a few more of them into my tools. Sorting algorithms are definitely useful so i'm sure this will be a good thing to practice. Here is a list of the ones that i'd like to get some practice with:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
