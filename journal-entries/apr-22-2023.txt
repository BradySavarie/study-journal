I'm currently in a coffee shop and all of the required materials for the data structures & algorithms lesson that im' working on requires watching videos. I think I may focus on that this afternoon and instead practice writing some sorting algorithms for a little bit. I did merge sort the other day which was alot of fun so I think it would be beneficial to toss a few more of them into my tools. Sorting algorithms are definitely useful so i'm sure this will be a good thing to practice. Here is a list of the ones that i'd like to get some practice with:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Bubble Sort was pretty easy. Just a nested for loop that compares the value of 2 elements within the input array and swaps values if the first is larger.

Insertion Sort was a little trickier for me but not too bad. Instead of having the maximum value bubble up through the unsorted array like in bubble sort, the minimum value bubbles into position through the sorted array. It's better than bubble sort because you don't need to know the value of each element in the unsorted array in advance, instead elements can be inserted one at a time if necessary. It can be compared to a card game where the dealer hands you one card at a time and you organize the cards in your hand by value one at a time as you receive them. You just insert the the new card into its position in the already sorted cards.

Selection Sort was another quick one for me. It requires initialing a min variable to the current index of a loop that goes through each element in the input array. An inner loop compares it's current value to the minimum value and updates the min value as it finds smaller elements. When the loop is over the min value is exchanged with the value at the beginning of the array making it sorted, and an outer loop repeats this process with the remainder of the unsorted array.
