I'm currently in a coffee shop and all of the required materials for the data structures & algorithms lesson that im' working on requires watching videos. I think I may focus on that this afternoon and instead practice writing some sorting algorithms for a little bit. I did merge sort the other day which was alot of fun so I think it would be beneficial to toss a few more of them into my tools. Sorting algorithms are definitely useful so i'm sure this will be a good thing to practice. Here is a list of the ones that i'd like to get some practice with:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

Bubble Sort was pretty easy. Just a nested for loop that compares the value of 2 elements within the input array and swaps values if the first is larger.

Insertion Sort was a little trickier for me but not too bad. Instead of having the maximum value bubble up through the unsorted array, the minimum value bubbles into position through the sorted array. It's better than bubble sort because you don't need to know the value of each element in the unsorted array in advance, instead elements can be inserted one at a time if necessary.
