I finished off last night by writing some pseudocode for the drag part of the drag and drop functionality. I'm going to make a new branch in my battleship project and implement that now. While i've studied branching and merging techniques extensively enough I haven't actually implemented them in a project of mine so this practice will be good. My workflow as far as version control is concerned needs to be refined quite a bit. My commits are pretty messy and usually an after thought right now. I tend to add the entire repo to the staging area after making alot of unrelated changes, and then committing it all as if it only accomplished the single thing outlined in the commit message I write. I'd like to make sure I get into better git habits before working on a team.
