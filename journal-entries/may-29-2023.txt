Yesterdays orders:

Tomorrow I would like to lock in the styling choices, find a good favicon (not many options online that I liked), add a status header that shows the results of each turn in text, and write a function that checks the end game conditions. This should be enough to keep me busy for the afternoon. If I hapen to sort it all out quickly I can also design the end game screen UI as well as render the sunken ships. I think after that all I will have left is writing the documentation and publishing it all to github pages. Heck yea, this was my favourite project so far. Lot's of growth happened over the past 2-3 weeks of working on it.

I'm going to start with the styling choices. Should be an easy enough win to get some momentum going.

Okay we're looking sharp. Favicon hunting time.

Done. Nice. Time to work on the status header now (which might actually end up being a footer instead come to think of it).

Okay status message is being rendered based on the turns attack status! I now have the choice to either figure out how to identify sunken ships and render them to the board along with a corresponding status method, or I can write the functions that check to see if the turn resulted in a loss or victory. 

I'm feeling a little bit iffy about whether or not i'm writing spaghetti code right now. I know that I don't quite know better yet so the point is to finish the project, but I can't help but feel that i'm making mistakes that i'm not even realizing. I need to get comfortable with this feeling either way so i'm going to keep moving forward until the game is in solid working condition, and then from there I will try to hunt down another dev to help me with a code review. Hopefully I can find somebody that is willing to help out.
