Alright, time to get started on learning about typescript classes.

Well that was pretty straightforward. Eseentially I just need to initialize the class properties first and define their types. Then, when I use the constructor I also need to define the input type for each since it doesn't know yet that the input parameters will be set equal to the properties on the instance of the object being created. Methods can also be added on as usual, nothing else seems to stray from what i've learned in the past. Instances can also be created normally without needing to define types since they have already been defined in the class. I'm going to go watch a video on access modifiers (public, private, readonly) and then once I understand that topic I will update my battleship code to be in line with what i've learned.
