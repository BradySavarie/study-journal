I've been on a side mission today to set up my resume so that I can begin applying for marketing coordinator and related positions when they come up. I think this would be a good way to earn a few extra dollars and gain more relevant experience (many of them list basic programming skills as an asset such as HTML and CSS). I am applying for one job now with Sunwire and once that is done I am going to continue with the binary search tree program (i'm excited to spend time on it, I read about insertion/deletion today and I think I have a general idea of how to approach it).
