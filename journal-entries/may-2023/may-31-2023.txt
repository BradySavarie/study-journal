Okay about to get started on the end game checks for battleship. The goal is to have a function that changes the game state variable if the end game conditions are met, and then another function to render the end game screen if the value of the game state variable is victory or defeat.

All end game conditions and rendering is complete. Heck yea. The app is officially a fully functioning representation of Battleship. The last thing on the last to do is make the AI smart, which of course I am expecting will be a bit tricky. I mean I coooooould just generate random coordinates and move on (i'm super stoked to get around to learning React), but that wouldn't feel right after all this effort haha. Not to mention I have to write up some documentation and get this hosted on Github pages too. A little admin work to tie things up is no big deal. I actually have to do the same thing for my weather api project as well, maybe I should take an afternoon and focus on polishing up both github repos so I can move forward with a clean slate.
