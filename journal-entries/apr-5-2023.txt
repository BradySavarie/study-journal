Today i'm going to be studying asynchronous programming. Just last night I learned about the topic itself and todays goal is to read a chapter from 'You Dont Know JS' about callbacks so that I can really solidify how they work in my mind. I'm already feeling pretty comfortable with them now but I now just how excellent this book is so i'm sure I will learn some new things and it never hurts to get in the repitition. If I get through it all today than I will be ready tomorrow to read the chapter on Promises. 

I'm pretty excited about the concept overall. It was neat to learn yesterday that Web API's are run separate from the javascript runtime thus allowing the code to continue executing while it does its work. The video that I watched that taught me how these resolved/rejected API calls end up in a task queue which is then tossed back onto the callstack by the event loop once the stack is empty was very helpful for understanding how this can all work. A notable concept was that setTimeout functions can be a very useful way to control the execution order of functions by tossing them into the task queue and therefore controlling the executable codes position within the call stack.
