Okay time to get going on the receiveAttack function now. Last night I had started watching a boostrap tutorial but ended up passing out after like 15 mins so didn't get much out of it. Maybe i'll continue that later today. As of now i'm not sure that this is actually the best project to learn how to use a component library. I think I need to see more in-depth how they work before deciding because practicing some scss could also be a good choice.
