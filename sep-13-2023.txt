Diving back into the mongoDB course now! Starting half way through unit 5 where I get to learn more about finding documents and making queries.

So far so good. I now know how to accomplish half of the basic CRUD operations in mongoDB: inserting and finding documents. I've learned how to use comparison operators and logical operators (combined or alone)in my queries as well to narrow down the results. Figuring out how to do this also improved my understanding of how complicated MongoDB's data structures can get. You can have deeply nested documents (also called embedded documents), all with complicated fields of their own such as arrays of more nested documents. You can use dot notation to query into an array and regular object notation to go into these nested documents. When the data increases in complexity it can get a little challenging to target specific fields but I think I have a grasp of how it works.
