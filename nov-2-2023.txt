Alright made a lot of progress last night with the app. The complexity really started ramping up actually. I created a user context to share user information throughout each component. I've also got more state being managed locally in the register and login components. In addition to that I have learned how to create jwt tokens and send them to the browser as a cookie.

I'm going to start todays session by doing a recap on all of the code that has currently been written in this project to ensure I can explain everything that is going on clearly. Hopefully this helps with being able to write this quality of code myself in the future.

Alright did alot of good work but ive been struggling alot with receiving a null user object for some reason. Going to have to hash that out some more tomorrow cause my brain i exploding trying to find the problem.
