I have found a tutorial to work through! I couldn't find a blog project so instead decided to choose a social media application. It uses all of the technology that I was looking for: node, express, mongo, react, and even mui. I also get to learn Redux along the way I believe which will be nice to add to the resume! Getting some more practice with the context API would be cool but I could always get a refresher on it later if necessary. I know that I can make it work so that is all that really matters. It is a 7 hour long tutorial, I should learn alot from it (hopefully more so than I would from doing the members only project). The big plus is it will give me a design so I don't have to sweat that at all. I'm going to be coding as I go and if I come across any good ideas for iterating on the project and making it more my own I think I will do that as well. I'm at a coffee shop right now that has pretty good wifi so i'm going to plug the headphones in and get the ball rolling now.
