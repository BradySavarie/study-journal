Okay time to get moving again with the airbnb-clone. I'm learning alot so far in this project about what kind of challenges arise when making a full-stack application. The communication between the api and the client is pretty interesting so far. I wish I was learning more about server-side rendering but hey I can get around to that later and consider this the intro to full-stack. I stopped yesterday when the tutorial started getting into authentication. It looks like I will be using JSON web tokens instead of sessions to communicate with the browser. Data is stored in these web tokens about the user and sent to the browser as a cookie. The actual user information is kept in the JWT though so that the information doesn't have to be retrieved from the server to authenticate a user each time a new request is made like how sessions work. I have alot more to learn about it so i'm going to go dive in now.
