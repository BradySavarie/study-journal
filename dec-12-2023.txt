Today i'm going to focus on learning the pen tool in illustrator. "What does that have to do with web development?!", you might ask. Not a whole lot lol. But design skills will transfer to making better UI's, and I want to get better at design in general so.

I've also read another chapter today all about the design principle of alignment. I learned why center aligning everything is not a great plan of attack! I knew this was the case but didn't know why because it looks 'fine'. The reason is that elements that are aligned down their center do not a have a strong point of alignment. Obviously you can imagine a line down the elements centers and see that they are lined up there, but left or right aligned provides a very strong, clear indication of where exactly the point of alignment is. It is bolder, and looks alot less amateur. Center aligning still has it's use cases like when you are going for a soft, or more formal vibe. But generally you want to create impact and you can do that by not defaulting to always centering everything. I needed to learn this, and now I need to apply it.
