Time to work on my Figma skills some more. Made it about an hour and a half into that course last night... and then I realized that this free video was only the first portion of a pad course haha. It's only $12 and covers all of the Figma essentials though so i'm thinking I might actually just go through it regardless so I can have this technology down solid.
