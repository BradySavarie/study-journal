Okay so today I am going to mess around with MaterialUI and try to make a good looking application. The goal isn't to complete styling really but instead to learn about how to use mui and styled components together. I would like to pull in some default components and add custom styling to make them suit my app better. I want to learn about best practices as well and I heard themes is a good place to start as opposed to writing custom styles for every component. I want to get the hang of layout as well, as far as I know there are some components designed specifically to make that easier.

Made some good progress tonight. I have the cards and the grid all setup and ready to go, and I have a visualization of how I want this app to look on completion. Things left to do include creating a flipping animation for each card when the user selects one, styling the scorecard which will sit in the top right corner of the header, including a 'logo' in the middle of a header, and including a dark'light mode toggle option in the top left. I haven't used color themes yet in any projects so I figure this will be a good time to learn how to do it, especially since I haven't dove into themes quite yet with the component library. Once that is all good to go I can either eliminate the gameover screen altogether and have games restart automatically, or I can style up that screen. Not sure yet.
