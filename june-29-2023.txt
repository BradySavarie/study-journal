Okay so today I am going to mess around with MaterialUI and try to make a good looking application. The goal isn't to complete styling really but instead to learn about how to use mui and styled components together. I would like to pull in some default components and add custom styling to make them suit my app better. I want to learn about best practices as well and I heard themes is a good place to start as opposed to writing custom styles for every component. I want to get the hang of layout as well, as far as I know there are some components designed specifically to make that easier.
