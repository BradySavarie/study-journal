Alright time to get started. Tonights goal is to make it through the first testing lesson in TOP entirely. SHouldn't be too difficult now that I have everything configured. If I have time leftover I am going to move forward into the next lesson as well. I am itching to get going on the project os the sooner I can get these lessons taken care of the better.
