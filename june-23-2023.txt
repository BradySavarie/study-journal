Last night I had made a new blank react project using Vite for the first time. I didn't get the chance to really explore the directory at all so that's where i'm going to start today. Once I have a good feel for what is going on I plan on pulling up a txt file and planning out how the memory-cards application is going to work. I'd like to make decisions on what functionality I want to accomplish exactly, then figure out which components I will need in order to make that happen. From there I can plan how i'm going to be using state and effects within the components in order to accomplish the desired functionality. Then I can map out which methods I should need to make everything happen. Once I feel confident with my planning I want to dig into integrating typescript with react. One benefit of Vite is that it configures typescript right away if you use react-ts as the template when creating the directory. I don't yet understand how to work with static typiing within the react framework though so I need to get an understanding of that first off.

Okay, let the planning begin!
