<h1>ðŸ§  Study Journal</h1>

This repository will store notes and journal entries that I write while learning how to program. Hopefully it will encourage me to reflect on what i'm learning via writing it down so the topics sink in deeper during the learning process and I can one day look back to see just how much progress i've made.

The journal entries will often be intentionally written from a "teacher" type of perspective because I find that explaining concepts to others in my own words really helps me identify the holes in my own logic and therefore provides an oppportunity to correct myself and expand on what i've learned.
