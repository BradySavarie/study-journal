Christmas Eve with the family was pretty awesome today. I received the book Logo Modernism by Jens Muller as a gift from my parents which is very exciting. This book is a cornerstone reference for logo inspiration that my favourite designer Jesse Nyberg uses often. I have spent probably 45 minutes today reading through the first portion of it and have been really enjoying the artwork that i've come across so far. I think a nice challenge will be to recreate a bunch of these logos in illustrator to help improve my technical skills. I am really intrigued about the concepts of grids now and how I can use them to help me create these types of designs. I really like the simple. gemomteric approach to creating that requires creativity but within certain boundaries. I need to learn about grid theory to really be able to take advantage of this.
