I made a little list today of some items that I would like to be included in my portfolio. I'm not sure yet on how strong the concept really is because im mixing print materials, signage, and web design as the main categories. That may be considered a little bit vague regarding what my skillset and desired type of work is which is a concern but I also don't want to put myself into a box when im not sure what type of designer I actually want to be. I defintely want some web work on there so I can emphasize that I have a skillset in coding. But I also want signage/print work included to reinforce my experience in that realm. I hope it's not a case of needing to choose one or the other in order to get people interested. Anyways, the important thing is to just get some work completed so that I can atually have a portfolio in the first place. That's the main thing lol.
