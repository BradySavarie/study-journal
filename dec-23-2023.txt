Made it all the way up to the effects section of the course last night. I made a paper-cut effect graphic that allowed me to practice using compound shapes and clipping masks as well as recolor. It was a fun lesson. I then learned how to work with artboards as well which is a simple albeit important topic. It is basically the same thing as pages in corel except they can all be viewed simultaneously which is convenient. I can duplicate artboards with or without the graphics contained within it which I know comes in handy. Now it's time to learn all about a bunch of wacky effects.
