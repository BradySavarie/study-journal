Today I am on a roadtrip so i'm not expecting to get a whole lot done unfortunately! I'd really like to get an hour in of studying tonight once i'm settled in Ottawa, and I will try to find to some audio resources that contain dev information that I can perhaps soak up while im driving. I will over the weekend be putting my time in though and Alex(friend im visiting) will be sleeping early on Sunday so I will probably have the extra time available then to put in some more work to make up for todays lack of it. Oh well, just a little bump in the road of learning.
