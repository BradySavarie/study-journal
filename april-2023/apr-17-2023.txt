I just finished up working on the weather app. It turned out to be a pretty straightforward project! The actual problem-solving was pretty minimal as the only new concepts that I needed to make use of was aysnc coding in order to fetch data from the API, but I don't find that is difficult to do so it went smooth. I decided that since I had learned the topics that I set out to learn with this project and it won't be a big portfolio piece I am going to actually move on without putting some heavy effort into styling it up. I'm not sure how much value that will actually provide and I would prefer not to spin my wheels on visuals right now when I can be plowing ahead in the course. I did however do some new things with styling that I haven't bothered with yet in this project! I configured sass and used it to write the css. I did not by any means use it to its full potential, but two concepts that I did explore is variables and partials. Variables is almost redundant since vanilla css already has them built in, but it is a slightly shorter syntax so I am glad to know it still. Partials are pretty cool. It is basically a way to create modular css by bundling up "partial" css files into a main file. The use case for this project was implementing different UI components in their own file and then importing them into the main scss file for ease of readbility and separation of concerns. Made life easier for sure.

Other feaatures I would like to implement next time I use sass are mixins (!!!) as they seem helpful in reducing the amount of code that needs to be written, and the other variety of @ rules avaiable such as @function and @use. Overall I think writing basic css without tailwind was fine, but i missed having the design system set in place for me.
