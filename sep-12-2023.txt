Last night I had gotten up to part way through the fourth unit of the MongoDB course. The third unit was all about the MongoDB document model. We covered what the document model is, and then dove into how to create databases, collection, and documents within MongoDb Atlas. Not difficult at all to follow really. The neat thing about documents is that they actually store data in a format called BJSON, which is why it seemed so similar to JSON. This format is essentially an extended version of JSON that includes compatibility for extra data types such as ObjectID (which is what is used to store document ID's automatically), dates, regEx, etc. The B stands for binary, which means that the data is binary-encoded. This allows for quicker parsing and serialization of data than storing data in a string-based format like JSON. Serialization is just the process of converting data into a format that can be easily stored and understood by all systems by the way, which is beneficial when using different software programs, keeping the data in long-term storage, or transferring it over a network.
