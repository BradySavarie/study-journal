Starting tonight off with an MDN lesson that has me building a little library app with Express. It will be a series that TOP will work through in it's entirety. Right now I am required to complete the section that walks through creating a skeleton website (using Express App Generator I believe). All of the content covered in this lesson of TOP besides this mini project was just review by the way. Covered a little bit of info on Middleware and View Engines but didn't really go into detail yet.

Cool so i've gotten throguh that entire lesson on setting up the skeleton of a project using express application generator. It just creates a boilerplate application as expected, similar to how a tool like Vite or Create-React-App would work. It gives you a basic file structure with all of the main routes, middleware, etc all setup and ready for use. Now i'm on the following lesson that revolves around Mongoose. The tutorial teaches you that an object data model (AKA object-relational model) is what you use to interact with databases in an object-oriented way so that it is more familiar to a javascript programmer. Each database driver has it's own syntax and it can be a little wordy and have a bit of a learning curve. Mongoose is an ODM specifically for MongoDB that acts as the interface to simplify working with data. 

The lesson goes on to cover what a model is. A model is justthe stucture that you choose to define for a certain type of data. You can have many types of models for different types of data that is stored in a database. MongoDB has what's called a flexible schema so these models don't need to maintain consistency necessarily (they are polymorphic), but in many cases it is better to design them to be so there are options for keeping things strict. I'm about to learn more regarding how to actually do this with Mongoose.
