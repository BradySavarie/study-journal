Starting tonight off with an MDN lesson that has me building a little library app with Express. It will be a series that TOP will work through in it's entirety. Right now I am required to complete the section that walks through creating a skeleton website (using Express App Generator I believe). All of the content covered in this lesson of TOP besides this mini project was just review by the way. Covered a little bit of info on Middleware and View Engines but didn't really go into detail yet.
