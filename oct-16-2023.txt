Onwards again with the PassportJS tutorial! Tonight I get to study the configuration of the framework itself. I haven't been spending as long as i'd like to lately on coding, i've just been barely scraping an hour a day on average. I would like to get back into the swing of things, hopefully some positive momentum will help get some motivation going as i've been running on discipline alone haha. Perhaps when I get to the full-stack projects I will become addicted again, that feeling is awesome.
