Okay today i'm going to start building my first react app! I'm not expecting it to be too much of a challenge yet. The main focus is to build an app that renders an input and a button, and when the button is clicked the input content adds a task to an array and then renders the contents of that array to the screen. 

I'm going to be using create-react-app for this since it's quick and easy, and it will allow me to get a bit of experience using it at least before moving on to other react build tools like Vite.
