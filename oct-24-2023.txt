Last night ended up being pretty fun. I decided to try my hand at coding one of the interview questions myself and did an alright job at it. The question was reasonably easy though, I just had to figure out how to capitalize every second character of a string. The solution that I ended up with was just about the same as the one the person being interviewed came up with. Gave me a bit of confidence even though I know that i'm bound to asked much more difficult questions.
