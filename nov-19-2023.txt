I think I work good on tighter time frames or something! I was able to get all of the authentication logic taken care of yesterday while waiting on my sister to get ready. Didn't spend much time coding but made decent progress. The user data is now being sent to the browser as a token so I will be able to decide now how to use the data. 

I just navigated through a minefield of authentication haha! I setup a user context and provided it to the whole application. Works like a charm. I ran into a lot of issues but solved the problems that arose on my own which is fantastic. What was great about my approach to solving the problems tonight was that I was comfortable breaking things, identifying the behaviour that is happening vs what I want to happen, and then making the necessary adjustments. In the past I would have been scared to break things in case I couldn't finx them but tonight I had the confidence to just go ahead and destroy the code base because I knew that if a problem came up i'd be able to figure out what I need to do to get it to work. That's huge, great coding session!
