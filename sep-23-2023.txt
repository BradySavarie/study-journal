Today is going to be all about deployment. Dynamic server-side applications can't be deployed using services like Netlify or GH Pages because these services are designed to handle static single-page applications. There is no server-side code that uses dynamic data, it is all baked into the pre-built files that are sent to the browser. Instead I can either learn how hosting/deployment works from scratch which is a huge topic, or I can start by getting comfortable with a PaaS. A PaaS is a platform as a service which allows you to deploy server-side applications. The PaaS abstracts away many of the infrastructure management tasks so that you can get your site up and running quickly and with minimal complexity. I think this is a good place to start.

The problem with using a PaaS is that they are paid services with limited free tiers, so I will be facing restrictions right away regarding what I am able to use the services for. There are many different PaaS's available that have different pros and cons and it is a little difficult to try and pick which one is right when you have never used one before, so I think I will follow the odin projects advice and just start off by using Fly.io as the PaaS and see what kind of problems I run into as I go. Supposedly I get to host 3 applications for free which is a great free tier options.
