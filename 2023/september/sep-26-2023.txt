I've got a lot of work cut out for me in this next lesson! The focus is all on working with forms. SHould be interesting as retreiving data from users via form submissions will allow me to perform the remaining crud operations and finish up programming this library tutorial application. I'm curious to see how to approach grabbing data from forms on the server side actually because it is something that I will be doing a lot of i'm sure. This tutorial has been awesome so far, really nice to put together a back-end application after working in the front-end for quite awhile. Can't wait to learn how to merge all of the front-end technology together with the back-end to create a real full-stack app. Getting so close now to having a solid foundation in programming. At least solid enough to start building some decent apps.

Well I made it through about half of the lesson this evening. Pretty in depth stuff, requires alot of anticipating problems that may potentially happen and finding ways to solve for them. Validating form data adds a lot of complexity into a project because it means that you need to re-render the form with an error message describing the problem as wells as ensure all of the data that the user input is not lost in the process. So when working with checkboxes, select inputs, etc you have to preserve their state. Something to keep in mind in the future when i'm designing forms for sure. The express-validator middleware is super handy though for this kind of thing since it has a bunch of great helper functions that does the heavy lifting for you and even provides a validationResult function that returns an error object to use to render the error messages. So far i've got 3 forms dealt with entirely which has resulted in creating authors, genres, and books successfully for the application. Next I need to be able to create book instances, delete any type of record in the database, and update records as well.
