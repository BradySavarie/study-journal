Yesterday I had completed the lifecycle methods lesson in the odin project. It was interesting to learn about, however i'm more interested in the lesson that i'm not on which is about hooks. I get the opportunity to learn about functional components now which seem to be far more popular for new codebases (legacy sites still have class-based components supposedly so knowing how they work is a good thing for sure). 

The goal today is to work my way through the content on hooks and get up to the point where I can start migrating the cv- builder code into functional components. I looked into the memory cards project a little further and I see now that I should get the chance to learn more about using hooks so I see the purpose of doing it now which is nice. I think I am going to make it The Simpsons themed since almost everyone will be able to recognize the characters. Anyways on to the studying!
