Tonight i'm planning on creating the effect instance routes and the empty controllers for them in the inventory app. Once that is done I can focus on making the corresponding models for the effects and effect instances. From there I will be able to decide on which other models to include (im thinking manufacturer and category).

Alright so i've finished up all of the above and have decided to go ahead with the manufacturer and category models. Tomorrow I will create them and then make the controllers and routes that they will use them. Once that is ready the next step will be to start digging into the controller functions and actually make them do what I want them to do. This will involve crud operations, rendering templates, etc. The actually logic is contained here basically.
