Well future Brady, some serious shit went down this weekend and not much coding got done unfortunately! Niece was born and sister nearly died giving birth. Drove down to Sault Ste. Marie last minute to spend time with everybody. I think that's a good enough excuse to halt progress. I'm pretty tired now, it's late and been a long day. I'm going to allow myself some rest I think. Maybe do some light studying in place of actual project work. The next thing that i'll be doing for TOP is creating the basic structure of my inventory application. There will be basically zero styling for this app since I already have a front-end built out that I want to integrate it with down the line, so the only challenge will be to create my own models and controllers pretty much. Should be an easy project since I basically just did something extremely similar for a tutorial.
