Continuing now with the PassportJS series. Got through alot of it yesterday. I learned about how cookies and express sessions work. It all pertains to storing data. Cookies do it within the browser while sessions do it on the server. Both of them expire after a set duration of time which is perfect for user authentication purposes.

The video that i'm learning from now is an in-depth tutorial on how exprss middleware work. I'm not sure whether or not it is necessary to cover as it is not PassportJS and I already have used middleware enough to know what it is. But hey, doesn't hurt to review topics and hopefully get some more information that I may have missed previously.
