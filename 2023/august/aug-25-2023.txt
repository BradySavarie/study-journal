Alright time to get started. I'm going to begin development tonight by creating a custom status component to insert into the header section. It will have a pulsing animation that runs on an infinite loop. It's a bit flashy but will be a nice little touch so i'd like to have it included. Once that is ready to go I can add the social link icon buttons into the left column to complete that section. They won't link to anything yet of course but hey they will exist and that can easily be pointed to the correct locations later. If I happen to have time I can then get started on inserting the photographs for dark and light mode in the right column.
