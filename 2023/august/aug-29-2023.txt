Yesterday turned out pretty good. I've got the majority of the projects section worked out, just have to add the technologies grid and the icon buttons below it to complete the card. Then ill just extract it as an component and include 3 of them with different information passed in as props. Should be pretty straightforward to finish up (I always say that... sometimes im right). The goal is to have a finished section by the end of the night. Tomorrow i'll make it responsive.

Nice so I finished the first project card! It's 1am, so it took about 3 hours to get right haha that was longer than expected. It looks great though on my laptop, just got to make it all responsive now which of course will be tomorrow at this point. I feel really solid about the code. I wrote a custom component that uses a prop (array of strings) to generate a map of typograph elements that contain the technology names for each project. They are grid items as well so a grid is automatically generated.
