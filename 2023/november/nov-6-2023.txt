Did a ton of refactoring to the airbnb site last night. Starting to really take shape now! I extracted a bunch of code out into it's own components and cleaned up the routing alot. This really improved the readbility of the code. Next I will be building the functionality that allows a user to edit their existing places. I have finished the creating and reading functionality so it makes sense to include updating next.
