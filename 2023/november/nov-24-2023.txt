Got offered the photographer/videographer job today. I'm not sure yet if i'm accepting it. When I did th emath last time I messed up pretty badly in only calculating what it would cost me per week and somehow thinkning that I had done a monthly calculation. That means it is 4x more expensive than I prepared myself for. Ouch. The plan right now is to wait for teh official written offer to come in and negotiate from there. I am also not thrilled about the idea of having to wear a uniform to go on shoots. I much prefer being an adult that isn't forced to dress a certain way. Not the biggest deal but I like being able to be myself at work. 

I'm thinking an angle I can take is to commit myself to learning their tech stack in my afternoons as sort of a value add and pitching that as the reason why I would be worth signing a deal to pay me a higher standard wage once the training period is up. I'm thinking asking for $23hr once I reach 3 months is reasonable. This will allow me to continue earning about the same as I am, I just have to convince the owner that i'm worth it. I am so torn on whether or not this job is a good idea.. i'm leaving such a chill environment. If management was better at Duplicators and I saw more growth opportunities it could have been so good. Shame to be considering leaving already. I'm actually pretty bummed out about it now that an offer is on the table.
