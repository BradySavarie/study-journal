Today is going to be mostly a rest day! I've been making good progress lately and woke up very tired today. I think it would be nice to get to bed a little early. Tomorrow is going to be all about working on the single place page which will really help make the application come to life. Once that is done I will be adding in the booking functionality. My goal right now is to have this whole project wrapped up by the end of the weekend.

I think that since I now have a way to make a front-end connect with a back-end I will feel alot better about tackling that members only project. Doesn't sound exciting to me but would be a good logical next step. I hate the idea of skipping over a project and it feels like my recent TOP projects have been done mostly by somebody else since they followed the MDN tutorial so closely. CLosing off the members only project would help overcome that and allow me to move forward without feeling like im missing anything.
