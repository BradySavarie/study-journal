I am officially on the advanced html and css section of the odin project now! Pretty exciting stuff to have moved past React and Javascript. Those courses were beyond amazing, I feel like i've learned so much within the past 8 months or so. What I like most about the odin project is the structure that is gives you and the projects that force you to put the concepts into practice so you actually build confidence with them. If I wasn't building these projects I strongly believe that I would have retained almost none of the information. It is crazy how many knowledge gaps you can open up when you force yourself to solve real development related problems.

Today I am going to go through the transforms lesson. Should be an interesting one, I think animations are fun and would like to know more about them.

Just made it through the transforms lesson. Was a quick one. I learned about creating 3d transformations using the perspective function which basically just unlocks the z axis. You can control what angle you are looking at the target object by playing around with the perspective origin which is pretty neat. If you move the origin to the right than it will look like you are viewing the obejct from the left. The 4 main transforms in css are rotate, scale, translate, and skew. All of them can be manipulated in 3d as well. I'm sure this gets complicated when working with complex shapes but the concepts is self is straight forward, especially since I work with graphics all day. One new thing that came up was the idea of chaining transforms. You can just put a space in between the transform functions to have them be applied to the object at the same time. Order does matter though - it seems like the transforms get applied from right to left when chained so this is something to keep in mind if needing to fine tune the position of an element or what have you.
