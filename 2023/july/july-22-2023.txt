Recap:

    - Write unit tests for each component
    - Instantiate and style product filtering component
    - Instantiate and style shopping cart component
    - Include hide/show shopping cart animation on click
    - Create add and remove items from cart functions
    - Hook up shopping cart logic to product cards, product page, and shopping cart components
    - Style not found page

I'm going to pick one of these goals a day moving forward. I expect to run in to some problems but this should at least ensure progress is being made and decision fatigure is reduced.

Today I am going to design the shopping cart component. I also want to continue now on the video I was watching for the ecommerce shop by web dev simplified to see if I can pick out any good styling tips to help speed up my workflow.

WHOA got alot done so far in just two hours. I have my shopping cart quantity related logic all sorted out and connected to my products. Each product can incremenet and decrement its quantity whic affects the total cart quantity and thus updates the number in the badge icon. When any cart button is clicked a drawer opens to show the cart, and if you click off of it than the cart is closed. Pretty awesome. I need to actually style up the cart itself and add information into it but I don't see that being too difficult really. Coming together quickly now, and is by far the best looking project i've created which is super exciting. I think it will make an alright portfolio piece by the time it's done!
