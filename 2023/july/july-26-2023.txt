Last night I had deployed the shopping cart application, pretty great. I still have to write all of the test for it, and admittedly it could be better for a responsivity stand point. I opened it up at work today on a larger monitor and noticed a few issues, same story with mobile. That being said I am going to take a break from working on it as i'd like to complete the two remaining React lessons. Today is going to be focused solely on The Odin Project. Crazy that i'm so close now to the back-end section! I still have to go through the advanced html and css section first but still, Javascript is done and React is so close. Feels good for sure. I'd like to learn how to use Next.js and Redux in the future as that seems to be a logical next step when it comes to building React applications. Probably best that I take a little detour from the node course when the time comes so I can focus on those things.
