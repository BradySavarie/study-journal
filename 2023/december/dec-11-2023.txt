Last night I spent a bit of time on learning about jwt but it was mostly just passive watching of a video. I am at the project now that requires me to build a blog. This is the last project before I hit the full-stack applications which is pretty darn cool. I've already built two now though regardless! After this blog I just need to finish up 1 lesson on testing Express (there are 2 in the course but i've completed one since it was super short). Pretty crazy to think that I managed to stick with this for over a year and made it to the end. These final projects are all that stand in the way and I still haven't decided whether that sense of completion is really worth the time I would spend putting them together. There are much better alternatives out there for my portfolio and I should really be considering that.

Regardless, I have started studying design as well. Today I read a portion of a big called 'The Non-Designers Design Book'. It covers some basic principles of design that I should be learning how to apply and so far has been great. I finished up 2 chapters, and the main concept that the book seems to be covered is CRAP. and by that I mean contrast, reptition, alignment, and proximity lol. 4 key principles that every good design uses well. I am going to continue tonight on my illustrator course though as my first step in this journey is to get comfortable working with the tools so that I will be able to express my design ideas once I start refining them. My main goal to start is going to be a nice UI for the local cat shelter. This is lofty as I really am not as well-versed on UI design as I thought I was when I started programming haha. At all. I think with some time spent on it though i'll be able to work something out for them that looks good.
