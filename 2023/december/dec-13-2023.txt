Made some good progress on that design book ive been reading today. I finished the two sections on repetition and contrast, which make up almost half of the book. There is one more section that provides tips on what to do/what not to do on a variety of different types of design formats(letters, brochures, etc). The second half of the book is all about designing with type. Pretty cool, i'd like to improve my typography skills. I feel it is probably my strongest design realted skill at the moment but definitely could still use alot of work. Hopefully I get some good actionable tips about the workflow involved with choosing fonts and how to approach font pairing.

I'm going to move on now with the illustrator course. I worked through the pen tool lessons yesterday and now I am going to learn about how to combine the pen tool with the other skills that i've developed such as the shapebuilder tool. Should be a cool lesson.
