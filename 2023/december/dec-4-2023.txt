Okay so it turns out that deployment is going to be a good challenge for sure. It seems like deploying both a front and back end requires different techniques and/or technology. I was initially going to rely on a video tutorial that showed specifically how to do this with my airbnb project but pretty much all of the comments are saying that they were not able to complete the deployment so i'm concerned about wasting my time. It seems the instructor for that video chose to use AWS for hosting which I have no experience with but may end up being valuable to learn about. Considering that option but I want to do some more research. I've also come across Render.com which looks pretty good as well.

I may need to follow that video and i'm in a coffee shop right now without any access to headphones so I can't really move forward without audio. Perhaps I can move forward with the odin projects next lesson instead in the meantime.
