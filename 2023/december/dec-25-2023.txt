I recreated 6 of the logos that are on the front cover of the logo modernism book today in illustrator. It was good practice, learned quite a bit about working with grids and the pathfinder options. Going to keep on expanding the ai file to include a bunch of them for the sake of getting some practice in. Might help prepare me to come up with my own ideas in a geometric kind of style after having made a buch of somebody elses designs.
