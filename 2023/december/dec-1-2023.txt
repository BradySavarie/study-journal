GOing out tonight! Hopefully i'll have time when I get home to finish up this app but if not i'll put in some extra time throughout the weekend to get things sorted out. Pretty excited to have made it this far because it was a real challenge to be honest. Definitely the hardest stretch of the odin project for me. Looking forward to being able to check off a few more lessons and feel that momentum again. Idk if I will first do the cat shelter website though. Either way, great progress.
