Today was a challenge to say the least haha. It was crazy busy at work today after missing yesterday. I went on lunch and realized I had a flat tire so I spent an hour and a half getting that sorted out. I have to go get it actually changed tomorrow, I just needed to call someone to help get my wheel off because it was completely stuck. Bummer. I ended up staying until 6:30 to make up for the lost time. I got a revised job offer from that real estate photography company and declined it. The compensation package is very bad, I can tell they have no extra money to spare or are not willing to put it towards their staff. Not a situation i'm willing to be in. Then since I had a spare on my car I decided not to drive it to go the gym, but my mom offered for me to use her car so I went for a last minute late workout. Only managed to d 20 minutes of cardio and like 2 exercises before hitting the road. It was past 9 and my little bro was pressuring me to head out cause he was tired. Fair enough, I was too. I deserved today though after taking yesterday off to be honest... a relaxed yesterday = a super busy today and hey that's reasonable enough. Just glad i'm in bed now resting. Too bad its nearly midnight lol. Anyways all that to be said i'm not doing any programming I don't think, I need some time to relax before going to bed.
