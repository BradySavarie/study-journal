Not much to talk about today really! Just had a normal day at work. Strengthened a connection with a graphic designer and project manager in town though I suppose. The was a misprint in a sign that I made for the science north exhibits. I responded very quickly letting them know what the issue with the graphic was and that i've gone ahead and fixed it, and called the designer to ask if they wanted a proof. The designer expected to have to make the fixes themselves so it was a nice little gesture and sped things up for everybody. I know this is small but it's for a company in town that I would love to work with one day (Over the Atlantic) so every little interaction counts.
