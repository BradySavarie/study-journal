Alright so last night I learned about environment variables and then looked over all of the details of the authentication focused app that I will be building next. It is basically a messaging board that has a few details hidden (author, time sent) from users that are not members of the website. A user will be required to register for the site and login to their account to view a default dashboard. They can then change their membership status to active by inputting a 'secret password' into a form which will give them the necessary permissions to view all of the details of each message. Perfect project at this point in my learning development since it allows me to practice everything that i've learned about building express apps with crud functionality and a database, while also mixing in this new topic of authentication. I have no intentions of making it a very pretty project since I do not know how to integrate the font and back end yet with eachother.
