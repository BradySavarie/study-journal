Starting today off with learning about resolution in inDesign. Should be just a recap as i've spent a bit of time now studying resolution in the previous courses. After this I will be moving on to topics such as adobe fonts, adding drop shadows and popular symbols (trademark, copyright), etc. Kind of a mixed bag as the structure of this course follows the development of projects. So as the problems arise we learn how to fix them, rather than categorize certain topics. Anyways, moving forward.

Alright tons of work done this evening. I'm more than halfway through this course now and i'm cooking with gas. Got a magazine design on the go as the course project which has been pretty interesting to get into. It turns out that inDesign is basically microsoft word on steroids. I understand now the use case for it for sure and will actually be defaulting to it quite a lot for anything work that requires mixing graphics with text. The layout capabilities and text manipulation is far superior to the other programs.
