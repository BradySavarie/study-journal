Starting today off with learning about resolution in inDesign. Should be just a recap as i've spent a bit of time now studying resolution in the previous courses. After this I will be moving on to topics such as adobe fonts, adding drop shadows and popular symbols (trademark, copyright), etc. Kind of a mixed bag as the structure of this course follows the development of projects. So as the problems arise we learn how to fix them, rather than categorize certain topics. Anyways, moving forward.
