Today i'm going to be continuing with the ecommerce project configuration video to make sure i've got everything up and running and then i'd like to work through the important testing concepts included in TOP react testing lesson 1. 

Okay just finished up configuring and writing some basic tests! Learned alot. I have the application running with a Hash Router which will make deployment via gh-pages much easier once I get around to it. At the moment I have a home page route and a not found route running correctly which is nice. I also have tests that assert that these routes are rendering the proper content. This config feels rock solid and i'm pretty excited to use it to build this ecommerce shop from. I still have to get through the testing lessons and really dig into all of these libraries that I have installed (react testing library, jsdom, react-router, vitest) to make sure I understand the basic scope of each of them and why I want to have them all included in my project. I also want to get my github repo setup and prepared to be worked on. I might start there actually hm.
