Today I am going to start working on the CV project. My first actual React app, exciting! The goal is to write an application that takes an assortment of user input in categories such as basic info (name, contact, etc.), experience, education, skills, etc. and uses it to create a resume that can be downloaded as a pdf. You should be able to make edits to every field. This app will require having a solid understanding on using react's class components, props, and state. In the future I will return to update all class components into functional components, but for now I want to ensure that I understand how they work thoroughly. TOP recommends that I use create-react-app to setup my project, however I am on the fence about whether or not I am ready to explore Vite now. I feel pretty comfortable with the boilerplate the cra provides but i'm not positive that I have a very deep understanding about the inner-workings of the template that it sets up and the problems that come along with it. Maybe it's best that I still with it for this one project and than for the Memory Cards project that is coming up in 2 lessons I can go ahead and use Vite. That way I can say i've made a full app with both options and hopefully understand the differences a lttle better.

I can't wait until I start working on my own personal projects. I've got some awesome ideas worked out that i'm really excited to start implementing. I want to ensure I learn everything important before applying the knowledge to my own apps though so I will still go through TOP in it's entirety before moving forward with that.
