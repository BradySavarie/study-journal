Did a little bit of reading today about typography styles. I learned that serifs can be broken down into oldstyle and modern to further differentiate them. Oldstyle is meant to look like it was written by a scribe with a wedge shaped pen. It has a diagonal stress with more of a flowing, hand-written look to it (not to be confused with a script style though). The transition from thick to thin in the line is prety moderate but definitely there as the wedge-shaped pen would cause this naturally. The serifs have a slant to them. A modern serif font on the other hand has a vertical stress with alot of contrast in the line thicknesses. The serifs are horizontal and very thin relative to the thicker vertical lines. This modern style was derived from the fact that machines started becoming more common and the hard-written look started to fade as these types were mechanically developed.
