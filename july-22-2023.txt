Recap:

    - Write unit tests for each component
    - Instantiate and style product filtering component
    - Instantiate and style shopping cart component
    - Include hide/show shopping cart animation on click
    - Create add and remove items from cart functions
    - Hook up shopping cart logic to product cards, product page, and shopping cart components
    - Style not found page

I'm going to pick one of these goals a day moving forward. I expect to run in to some problems but this should at least ensure progress is being made and decision fatigure is reduced.

Today I am going to design the shopping cart component. I also want to continue now on the video I was watching for the ecommerce shop by web dev simplified to see if I can pick out any good styling tips to help speed up my workflow.
