Time to move on with the nodejs course! Unfortunately I have the internet is down tonight, hopefully the tech comes and fixes it tomorrow. Because of that I don't plan on spending time much time watching the videos, don't want my data to go through the roof, but i'm going to review the concepts that I learned yesterday in detail, maybe play around with them a little bit in vscode.
