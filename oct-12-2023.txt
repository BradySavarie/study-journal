Yesterdays resume revamp was worth it for sure, I feel more scure after having put it together. I did a phone interview today at a local sign shop too which is pretty cool. They said they want to schedule an in-person interview soon. Hopefully they follow through with that and don't contact my employer to let them know i'm interviewing haha. Paranoid but this kind of fear is necessary when trying to grow in my career. If the worst case scenario happens than i'll just spam out resumes all day until I get a new job, and if it sucks i'll find a better one. No big deal.

This afternoon i'm starting to learn about authentication. SHould be an interesting lesson. Getting into it now.
