I ended up finishing unit 6 last night! The updateMany and delete function are very straightforward to use. For the sake of time i'm not going to dive into the specifics as I can always look up the docs in the future. Time to move on now to unit 7 where i'll be learning about modifying query results.

Just learned how to sort and limit data in mongoDB. These methods are called cursor methods because they operate on the document that has been returned by a query. A cursor is something that helps you navigate, select, and manipulate data (just like using a mouse would, which is why we also call that a cursor). You would need a cursor then to sort through documents and limit the outputs. These are super simple to use. In the case of sort just pass in a document with a field tha tyou want to sort by and set the value to either 1 or -1 depending on if you want ascending or descending order. Limit is even easier, just pass in the number of documents you want to limit the results to.
