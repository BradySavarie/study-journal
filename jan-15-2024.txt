Getting to work on the inDesign course. I was thinking today of how important it is going to be to have a portfolio of work for design and development. I really should start trying hard to build that up. I want a mix of web and print design in there to show I can work with both. I'm thinking my first big project can be the band management app. I'll do the branding for it, then design a website, and then actually code it up. It would make for a good portfolio piece for sure.
