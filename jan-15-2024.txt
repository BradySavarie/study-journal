Getting to work on the inDesign course. I was thinking today of how important it is going to be to have a portfolio of work for design and development. I really should start trying hard to build that up. I want a mix of web and print design in there to show I can work with both. I'm thinking my first big project can be the band management app. I'll do the branding for it, then design a website, and then actually code it up. It would make for a good portfolio piece for sure. 

I'm enjoying inDesign so far. So far today i've learned how to layout a magazine and how the concept of spreads comes into play. Spreads are just the term for all visibile content that can be seen when flipped to a certain page. For example, after opening the cover of a magazine you will se page 2 and page 3. This is considered the first spread. It is often useful to reference them together because thet content may flow between them. inDesign has this concept built in to it's pages functionality. I also learned that since magazines are typically bound using folded 11x17 sheets, you have to work in page increments of 4 because it accounts from the front and back for both 8.5x11 folded sections. If you have 6 pages for example the binding would be messed up because you would need to bind a single sheet in between a folded sheet which causes production problems. Little interesting note there. Also, bottom margin is typically larger in this format so footer elements can have a little more space to be laid out. And the facing pages option in inDesign relates to documents that use spread. If the pages will be facing eachother (spreads will be included) than check this option. Instead of having left and right margins it will be inside and outside margins, which references the side of the page that the margin will be on relative to the spread.
