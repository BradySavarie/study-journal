Received some great feedback today on the portfolio site! Someone really took their time to point out the flaws that they noticed and one comment in particular was very helpful. Turns out my site looks horrible on desktop screens! I've only be designing for laptop size and below apparently. My goal is to figure out how to design properly for those large screens as well. Other comments were to have the animations only run once, reduce the text in the home page to a single sentence or two if necessary. Remove technologies from the technologies section that aren't being demonstrated on portfolio projects (could set off red flags). I thought my portfolio was a real banger haha so this feedback took me down a notch but man it is so nice to have someone provide that kind of value so I can fix it. Otherwise employers would have definitely been seeing all of those mistakes.

I will be coming back to that in the future when I intend on using the site. I've spent alot of time putting it together a need to move forward on to something fresh to keep momentum up. Tonight i'm charging forward with that nodejs series. Hoping to make some solid progress.
