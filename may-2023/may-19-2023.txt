Okay, starbucks and chill time. Game plan today is to intialize the start of the game using index.ts. By the end of this session I would like the game to be at a state where the controller model is ready to be worked on. This won't require the ability to check the state of the game which is a part of the game module as takeTurn will not have been called yet at this point in time.

Things that need to happen:
    - Two players are created. One computer and one human.
    - Computers ships are placed at randomly generated coordinates
    - Human is prompted to place their ships until each has been placed
    - Active player is set to human

Things are going good so far! Been working about an hour and the only thing that I have to accomplish still is figuring out how to prompt the user to place their ships.

After thinking about it a little bit more I realized that the human won't be prompted to place their ships on load up necessarily. It is just a specific view that will be rendered and their ships will be placed once a drag/drop event is triggered. So.. yea, with the exception of the rendering methods my index.ts is ready to go then. Time to start thinking about the controller module.

Okay i've created the game controller module and moved the logic from index.ts into a startGame method inside the controller. This clears up the index a little bit by only necessitating the single function call inside of it
