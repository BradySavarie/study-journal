Okay time to get going on the receiveAttack function now. Last night I had started watching a boostrap tutorial but ended up passing out after like 15 mins so didn't get much out of it. Maybe i'll continue that later today. As of now i'm not sure that this is actually the best project to learn how to use a component library. I think I need to see more in-depth how they work before deciding because practicing some scss could also be a good choice.

The receiveAttack function has been implemented. There was not a whole lot of trouble-shooting that went on there. Easy peasy, just a bit of conditional logic. I also wrote out basically all of the pseudocode for the model modules lgoci such as switching turns and checking end game conditions. I feel like I have a pretty clear idea of what I need to do now to get to the next part of this project - programming the controller and view modules. I also went ahead and implemented the computer class using an extension of the player interface. I could strip away the interfaces entirely to simplify the code, however I like the idea of keeping them in there so that the functionality would work well if I expanded into a 4 player version of the game or something like that with different methods. I won't, because this isn't useful to anybody but myself, but I know that im easily capable of doing so safely using interfaces and it is good practice to work with them.
