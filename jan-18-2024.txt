I'm feeling pretty happy with the work that I put in last night. That banner turned out nice, definitely boosted my confidence a little bit and gave me something small to add to the portfolio. Speaking of which, I better start gathering all of the things that i've done and shoving them into a folder or something haha. I need to have some examples of previous work ready for next week at least. I'm going to be relying alot of my soft skills to try and win this job but having something to back me up will most likely be necessary. 

I did the class exercise this afternoon which entailed creating a magazine spread again. it was pretty easy, I retained all of the information that I studied so far. I had the idea to design a small magazine as part of my portfolio. Perhaps that topic could be on sign making. I'm not sure if a magazine is the best format to be focusing on right now as it will take quite a bit of time to put together even just an 8 page spread that i'm happy with while i'm not sure if the employers that i'm aiming for will see value in it. It would be nice to have a bit of a longer form project like that though to show layout and type understanding and cater more towards the print design side of my skillset. I intend on having a few websites on the portfolio so this would be good to mix it up. I also want some signage, social media stuff, and marketing materials (tradeshow focused maybe).
