I'm feeling pretty happy with the work that I put in last night. That banner turned out nice, definitely boosted my confidence a little bit and gave me something small to add to the portfolio. Speaking of which, I better start gathering all of the things that i've done and shoving them into a folder or something haha. I need to have some examples of previous work ready for next week at least. I'm going to be relying alot of my soft skills to try and win this job but having something to back me up will most likely be necessary.
