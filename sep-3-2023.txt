Tonight i'm going to work on getting the contact form all set up. First thing I have to do i find a design reference, then once I have that I will build the form itself without styling. Afterwards I can add in the email functionality via emailJS and then finally style it up. I might also just add in the footer because why not, it will be a quick build.

Well today was ultra productive. I changed course and instead decided to code up the rest of the site as designed on figma rather than create the form. I will easily be able to add that in as a second column in my contact section when it comes to it. For now I wrote a function that copies my email or phone number to the users clip board on click which is pretty cool. everything is all styled up and ready to go, footer included, so basically all that I have remaining is perhaps that form (but idk, it looks good as it is. The functionality would be nice though..) and the animations.
