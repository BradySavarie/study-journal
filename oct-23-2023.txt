I'm pretty tired tonight so I think i'm going to watch a javascript technical interview to try and gauge where i'm at with my learning. I should definitely be working on my members-only project but I really need something more passive right now. Maybe even get to sleep a little earlier than usual today to hopefully make tomorrow easier. My focus is going to be registering a user into the database via a register view. So i'll need a get and post request taken care of within the user controller basically, and then i'll need to create a view to display a register form. The post request should use bcrypt to secure the password before it is stored in the database. Shouldn't be that challenging really, i've done this all before.
