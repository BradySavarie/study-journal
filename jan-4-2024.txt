Today was a successful day at work! I came up with some design concepts at work for 2 monograms that a customer asked for and I did so within the span of an hour. I used artboards to work through different iterations and came up with some designs that hit the mark. One of them was actually pretty unique and cool dare I say - i'm excited to have some of my studying pay off at work in such a short amount of time. Tonights goal now is to make progress on the photoshop course. I'm in a bit of a boring section but that's alright, it's gotta get done.
