I decided to start up the graphic design courses. It will be helpful for work if nothing else, and will allow me to confidently list the adobe creative cloud on my resume which is really important in the field i'm in. Might come in handy one day. So far i've finished a section on drawing. Super basic, just learned about how to work with basic shapes and use the shape builder tool to create some more complicated shapes. I created a pretty interesting butterfly graphic using impossible triangles.

I also am pretty happy with learning these tools because they are directly related to web design as well. I think it would be pretty neat to be able to learn webflow and adobe XD to use the design skills that I am developing to create some nice UI's. It's probably just because i'm not super comfortable with it, but I am not the biggest fan of Figma right now. I know it is important and I should get used to it but perhaps XD would be a good alternative to have under my belt as well.
