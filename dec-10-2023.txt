I decided to start up the graphic design courses. It will be helpful for work if nothing else, and will allow me to confidently list the adobe creative cloud on my resume which is really important in the field i'm in. Might come in handy one day. So far i've finished a section on drawing. Super basic, just learned about how to work with basic shapes and use the shape builder tool to create some more complicated shapes. I created a pretty interesting butterfly graphic using impossible triangles.
