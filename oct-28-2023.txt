still working on finding a suitable project to follow. I would like it to be nodejs/express based and contain authentication. I was looking into learning NextJS instead last night but I think it would be best to first get the technology that I know down well before moving on to the next framework. I do have intentions of using nextJs in the future though as it is a full-stack react framework that seems to really speed things up. SO for the this project I will need the technology to inlcude mongo, node, express, and react. Ideally typescript will be part o fit as well but I can take it or leave it depending on how difficult it is to find a good project with it included. Any css library would do but materialUI or tailwind would be excellent.
