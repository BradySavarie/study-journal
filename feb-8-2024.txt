Today was an awesome day at work. Got a call from a lady in Marketing named kayla and she asked me to come over there for a rush install of the some of the vinyl that I had printed out for them. They agreed to the quote so Chris and I ran out there to take care of it. It was the perfect install! The set us up with a nice work station, there was interesting things happening all over the place, the vinyl went on perfectly and we finished up like an hour early. We decided to browse around the 3rd floor for a little bit where all of the animals are since we were done early and we got the check out the whole floor. The porcupine looked fake, but it was not. I also got to meet Kayla in person and she was really cool. She will probably remember me now which is good because it means I have somebody in my network within marketing. Potential contact to reach out to in the future if I end up looking for marketing internships.
