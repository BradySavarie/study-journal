Last night I watched a lengthy video on accessibility devices and techniques that people with disabilities use to access websites. It provided some insight into what kind of accomodations I need to be prepared to make with the sites I build. Throughout the day today I had finished the lesson on accessible colors. The only information that I need to really keep in mind is that contrast matters, and it is measured as a ratio. The ratio is determined based on the difference in brightness levels between the foreground and background colors. To conform to AA standards of the WCAG you need at least a 4.5/1 contrast ratio. You can measure contrast using chromes dev tools just by hovering over the elements and selecting one that includes text. The contrast will be listed there. Alternatively you can paste the hex code values into a contrast ratio tool online, they exist out there for free.
