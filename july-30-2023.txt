I am officially on the advanced html and css section of the odin project now! Pretty exciting stuff to have moved past React and Javascript. Those courses were beyond amazing, I feel like i've learned so much within the past 8 months or so. What I like most about the odin project is the structure that is gives you and the projects that force you to put the concepts into practice so you actually build confidence with them. If I wasn't building these projects I strongly believe that I would have retained almost none of the information. It is crazy how many knowledge gaps you can open up when you force yourself to solve real development related problems.

Today I am going to go through the transforms lesson. Should be an interesting one, I think animations are fun and would like to know more about them.
