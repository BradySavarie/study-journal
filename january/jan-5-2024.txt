Started working on my first large project today at work that I decided to use the Adobe Suite for exclusively. Perhaps not the best choice as it is a pretty even mix of vector and raster elements which coreldraw is excellent for, but it's good pracice nonetheless. This might be a use case where inDesign would be a better choice. Not really sure as I don't know much about that program yet. Anyways i'm going to study blending modes now. Not going to be a long study session as I intend on going out tonight but better something than nothing!
