Well, looks like the credit card that is set to auto renew on the creative cloud license at work has been cancelled or something like that. I have tried to process payment and it won't go through, so it looks like I won't be making any progress tonight. On one hand i'm disappointed about it because ill feel guilty not doing anything of value, but im also kind of relieved because im feeling burnt out.
