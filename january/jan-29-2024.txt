Joe fixed the creative cloud today! Yay, all technology is available to use again. Not going to lie this break has been really nice haha. It actually has me questioning if I am putting myself through too much stress trying to constantly upskill. On top of that, i'm also questioning whether i'm learning the right skills in the first place. I am starting to get really serious about going back to finish my business degree and im struggling to understand how my career is going to develop. I don't see being a full-time web developer as a something that I will enjoy and the competition plus the downwards pressure on wages is very offputting. At the same time, I don't see a design-only job as something that I will fit in with as I do not love constant creative work and I don't really think i'm an artist. I can see myself fitting in to a marketing career best as the day to day work is varied and uses some creative and analytical thinking. I don't like the physchological aspect of it and the salesy kind of vibe. I'm not big into communicating with the public via social media and what not. But hey, a job is a job and marketing can be a lucrative career path and a very helpful skill to learn for entrepreneurship as well. I could use the business degree as a way to get into that career path, and empasize all of my supplemental skills. Seems like the best fit right now.. PLUS it is still possibly remote which is a huge plus as i'd love to actually travel someday. I think this is my new goal. Which means I can focus on developing my web dev and graphic design skills while earning money for the next 7 months until I go back to school in September. That is going to be the plan.
