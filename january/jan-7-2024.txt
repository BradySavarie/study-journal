Last night I decided to pend some time designing some random album art. I used the time as a way to experiment with brushes, texture, blending modes, and the liquify tool. It was a really awesome experience and I like the outcome. I used a soft brush to paint in areas on the background a variety of colors that I thought mixed well together, and then I used the liquify tool to melt it all together and create a look that is reminiscent of swirling paint. Once I had something that I liked I added noise to the image using the noise filter. I then used a gaussian blur on it to get a sort of frosted looking texture. Then for some extra grit I created a 50% gray color layer, added more noise to that, and used the overlay blending mode with the opacity reduced to dial in the amount of grain that I was looking for. I could have also used the camera raw's grain come to think of it, but now i'm familiar with a few different techniques which is always nice. I don't understand the differences between them though, or even why a 50% gray layer works with noise so well. Maybe that's another point that I can research soon. I would like to start the day though by making some progress on the course so that I can have some measurable progress being made. I noticed that I feel a sort of conflict when I switch between illustrator and photoshop by the way. Working between them feels like a struggle right now for some reason. I think it is a just a lack of comfort in the process, therefore I will need to spend some time going back and forth when they need arises so I can feel my skills are more intertwined with eachother.
