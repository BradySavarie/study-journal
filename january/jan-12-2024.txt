Working on the inDesign course tonight. I watched a video on how to make a portfolio and it was this vistuosic, design-student who made it. Damn the portfolio was really nice and must have taken so much work to put together. I should be feeling inspired, but if that is my competition and the level that I need to aspire to in order to be successful in this career I am just kind of scared. I'm nowhere near that level and won't be unless I completely dive in to design 100% which isn't what i'm trying to do here. I need to learn these skills to an acceptable level and start putting them to use in my development work asap.
