I made a little list today of some items that I would like to be included in my portfolio. I'm not sure yet on how strong the concept really is because im mixing print materials, signage, and web design as the main categories. That may be considered a little bit vague regarding what my skillset and desired type of work is which is a concern but I also don't want to put myself into a box when im not sure what type of designer I actually want to be. I defintely want some web work on there so I can emphasize that I have a skillset in coding. But I also want signage/print work included to reinforce my experience in that realm. I hope it's not a case of needing to choose one or the other in order to get people interested. Anyways, the important thing is to just get some work completed so that I can atually have a portfolio in the first place. That's the main thing lol.

I have made some progress on the inDesign course today. Really feeling good about it. So happy to finally have an understanding of what it is all about. I get the differences between the 3 main softwares now which is a big thing as they are the most used tools in design. I haven't decided which portfolio project i'm going to set my sights on first but i'm leaning towards some sort of print related project that can be done in a reasonable timeframe. Maybe that magazine would be best. Then after that I want to do the Adobe XD course and apply it to building my band management app. Finally will be able to apply my coding skills to something useful again once I do that! Seems like a good enough path to me.
