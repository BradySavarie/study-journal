Today was a successful day at work! I came up with some design concepts at work for 2 monograms that a customer asked for and I did so within the span of an hour. I used artboards to work through different iterations and came up with some designs that hit the mark. One of them was actually pretty unique and cool dare I say - i'm excited to have some of my studying pay off at work in such a short amount of time. Tonights goal now is to make progress on the photoshop course. I'm in a bit of a boring section but that's alright, it's gotta get done.

Got quite a bit done this evening. I worked through both the transform and retouching sections of the course. Transform ended up being more interested than anticipated because I learned about the liquify tool. It is a really nice tool for stretching parts of an image around in a very natural looking way. The retouching section just covered familiar topics like dodge/burn, spot healing, red eye correction, teeth and eye enhancement techniques, that whole shebang. Next up will be blending modes (which is a short section) and then visual styles. That will be tomorrows topics.
