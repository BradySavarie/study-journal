Not sure if I mentioned this in a previous entry but I have an interview coming up for a graphic design position. If I get a job offer I will almost certainly have imposter syndrome haha but i've got to jump on any opportunities that come my way in order to improve. Worst case scenario is I suck at they fire me. Which im afraid of.. but that would mean I find temporary employment elsewhere and go back to school to finish my degree. I am stagnating at Duplicators and that is dangerous.

I made a pretty nice pull-up banner design tonight for the portfolio! Mockup included. I'm pretty happy with it. I have found that my typography and color skills have really improved lately, and image manipulation using photoshop has been so helpful with this kind of design work.
