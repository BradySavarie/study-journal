In a coffee shop ready to get to work. Game plan this afternoon is to finish the first section of the inDesign course. It is a project based course so this will mean finishing up a flyer. Should be easy enough but perhaps time consuming.

I learned alot in that section! I have a big portions of the basics already down fromlearning the other progams. Very transferable with the way that inDesign is setup. One of the really neat things that I learned is the package feature that inDesign has. It is a great way to save all of the assets in a folder that can be sent to a client or colleague to continue work on the project. It contains the inDesign file, the fonts, the linked images, a pdf for previewing, and an idml file that allows users with older versions of inDesign use the project without compatibility issues. Once that file is created, rather than keep everything stored on your computer you can compress it which turns it into a zip file and delete everything else. This makes for a tidy package that can be archived in a simple to manage way and the zip file can be emailed (if the size permits) which is way better than trying to attach everything separately.
