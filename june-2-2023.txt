Stuck going to band today, not much opportunity to work on the project which suuuuucks. I'm going to try and get out early enough to at least be able to put in my hour. Either way though the plan is to go hard this weekend. I'm going to finish up battleship entirely, publish it to gh pages and make the repo look presentable. I may do the same to another project such as knights travails as well. My goal is to get my github back into really good condition so I can move forward knowing that I haven't left anything incomplete. I've aleady started digging into the first React lesson out of excitement haha it's really interesting so far. Looking forward to being able to spend my time focusing on it. I may or may not do the intermediate git lesson first... I know I should but I am impatient I guess haha.
