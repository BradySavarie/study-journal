Alright time to work on the library tutorial. Hoping to wrap it up tonight, we'll see how things go. I need to program the bookInstance delete functions and make all of the objects updateable. Going to get started now, i'll come back to the journal when progress has been made.

All done the mini project! That was alot of fun. I decided not to bother implementing updates for 2 of the models because I went through the process thoroughly for one of them, ran into a ton of issues, and solved it on my own. I feel comfortable now with how the whole process works and don't want to spend time going over it two more times just to operate on different schemas. I solved the problems and I can do it again, thats what matters. Moving on now with learning about deployment!
