Made it through the blending modes section last night. Didn't really learn anything concrete to be honest, just to flip through the different modes to see what effect it has on the layer beneath it. I'd like to learn more about how the modes actually work even though I understand I probably will just be flipping through most of the time regardless. I know the modes are organized into different section based on how you can expect them to behave (darken, lighten, etc) depending on the nature of the algorithm being used. For example, multiply darkens value because it takes the value of each pixel (for R, B, and G channels) and multiplies them together. Values are stored as percentages from 0 to 1 of course, so multiplying the values together will always result in a lower value. If I could get a similar understanding of the other blending modes I would be able to have a better idea of what mode will accomplish an end goal that I may have in mind.
