Made it through the blending modes section last night. Didn't really learn anything concrete to be honest, just to flip through the different modes to see what effect it has on the layer beneath it. I'd like to learn more about how the modes actually work even though I understand I probably will just be flipping through most of the time regardless. I know the modes are organized into different section based on how you can expect them to behave (darken, lighten, etc) depending on the nature of the algorithm being used. For example, multiply darkens value because it takes the value of each pixel (for R, B, and G channels) and multiplies them together. Values are stored as percentages from 0 to 1 of course, so multiplying the values together will always result in a lower value. If I could get a similar understanding of the other blending modes I would be able to have a better idea of what mode will accomplish an end goal that I may have in mind.

Just made it all the way through the visual styles section of the course. I enjoyed it. The styles that I learned about were duotone, anaglyph, and vintage. Duotone is basically just a gradient map that uses two interesting colors. It can be used for an entire image or just over portions of the image if it is applied to a selection instead. Pretty neat look that i'm sure I can make heavy use of. I see it in a lot of designs that are in the style I am interested in. Anaglyph is a 3D effect that makes use of 2 layers. One layer isolates the red channel and the other layer isolates the green and blue channels to create cyan. When the positioning of the layers are offset from eachother you get a weird 3D look to it as if you were watching a 3D movie with no glasses. This is more of a specialized kind of thing and honestly I don't understand how it works all that well. Im not sure if the layers are blending together somehow or not when the channels are isolated but I think that is the case because you need to go into photoshops advanced blending section to turn off the channels. I tried googling but didn't really find more information about how this effect is being created. Might try to do some further research on the advanced blending options for insight.

I also learned about creating a vintage look however this is something i've done alot of before. Just cruhsing the blacks and whites to reduce contrast and adding things like texture layers that are blended and vignettes. The video creator did however do 2 things that I haven't explored much. He boosted the shadows of the blue channel using a curves adjustment layer and reduced the highlighs down. This somehow created a teal and orange style like, although quite subtle. He also added a high pass filter and used it to sharpen up just the edges of the image, then put that through a blend mode to create a textured kind of style as well. Coll stuff.
