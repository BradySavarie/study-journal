I finished up that 3 hour figma essenntials video last night. Learned alot about how to use the software. There is still quite a bit of topics that I need to research to really understand how to use it in its entirety however I think I can learn those as I go rather than pay for the course. I noticed that the couse itself contains alot of content on UX design which is not what I want to be spending my time learning right now. I think I will use the syllabus as a guide to find free content and pick just the topics that I feel are relevant right now. For example, I researched components in figma today which was a topic further in the syllabus and it seems like it will come in handy. Especially for larger websites. For now i'm going to practice what i've learned and continue working on the design for my portfolio. I bet I will run into some problems there which can help me identify where my knowledge gaps currently are.
