Last night I did some 'skill stacking'. I basically just used every skill that I have learned in illustrator up until this point to draw a swan graphic from a sketch. It was pretty interesting and I feel I am in a better position now to be able to manually vectorize graphics quite well. I also learned how to use a tool called generative recolor. It is a really nice way of taking a graphic that has some tonal variation in it and generating a bunch of color schemes for it as inspiration. You use text prompts that feed into an ai and the output is 4 variations based on the prompt. Neat stuff.

Tonight i'm going to be focusing on trying to finish up the pen and curvature tool section of the course. There is a lesson and project centered around the concept of moodboards, and another project that involves the creature i've made previously as well as a lesson on tshirt making. Getting started now.
