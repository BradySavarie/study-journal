Last night I got through a good portion of the intro to accessibility to lesson. I pretty much just learned about what disabilities need to be accomodated for and why it is important to do so. I looked through the WCAG guidelines to get a general idea of what requirements need to be met in roder for a site to be considered accessible. A site will never be 100% accesible, sometimes certain fatures are naturally impossible to make that happen such as a voice-assistant, but the WCAG has conformity measures to rate how accessible a site is. There are 3 levels of conformity: A, AA, and AAA. A is just essential, so a minimum required conformity. AA is what most businesses strive for as it is a very well-rounded, thoughtful approach to making sites accessible to most users in a way that doesn't impede on progress too much (or cost alot more to develop). AAA is specialized and is considered going above and beyond to meet accessibility needs for particular use cases. Something to keep in mind is that a11y isn't just to be accomodating to users or follow certain laws, it is beneficial for everybody because it makes technology better designed and expands a businesses customer base. It serves both parties well to take it into consideration.
