Well I did some great work yesterday and I had a super long day today so I think i've earned a little bit of an easy night! I'm going to research how other people approach including the technologies section of their portoflio and see if any inspiration strikes from a design perspective. I'm not a huge fan of what i've put together at the moment so it wouldn't hurt to see if I can make some improvements. Something animated would be nice, perhaps using framer motion. I'll see whats out there. Also making small changes such as adding my live and github links to the project cards and what not.
