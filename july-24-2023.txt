Just spent about 45 mins learning about positioning elements as sticky. Took a bit to really get it to work with mui as there was some weird max-width problems going on but i figured it out and my navbar is now positioned that way. Pretty cool. Moving on tonight to handle the filtering component, and i'd like to add more pedals to the collection to make sure the shop page is more full looking when filtered. Shouldn't be too difficult of a session today.
