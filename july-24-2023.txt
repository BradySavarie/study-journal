Just spent about 45 mins learning about positioning elements as sticky. Took a bit to really get it to work with mui as there was some weird max-width problems going on but i figured it out and my navbar is now positioned that way. Pretty cool. Moving on tonight to handle the filtering component, and i'd like to add more pedals to the collection to make sure the shop page is more full looking when filtered. Shouldn't be too difficult of a session today.

Boom, filter by brand is done! That was a great challenge. This site is looking so awesome now. I could definitely deploy it as is however I might add a couple small features in to just help set it apart from other peoples portfolio pieces. I'm thinking a filter by price function would be nice to have, and then a sort by price (high and low) may be a good way to add extra functionality as well.
